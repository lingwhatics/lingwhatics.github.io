<p>Well today I got up bright and not really that early at 8 a.m. because I had a Business Law midterm at 9. The test wasn't too bad, though I wasn't really that worried about it. After that I returned to my room to study for my Economics midterm which was at 3.</p>
<p>I went to my two classes in between and they were not too bad. And then Econ, which was really a good exam. It was mostly logical things followed by a few calculations. I am almost half done all my midterms now. I have two more new ones then another in Business law and my last midterm of the semester is Economics again. However, I get almost two weeks before the next midterm, then I have one a week for four weeks.</p>
<p>That's really all for now. I think I should get to bed.</p>
