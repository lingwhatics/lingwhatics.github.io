<p>Well getting y'all up to date is too much for this hour of the day because I should be going to bed.  I just had to rave about how cool my new toothbrush is.  It's just amazing.  My teeth feel as if they are actually clean.  It's just great.</p>
<p>Anyway,  I'm thinking I should get more work done tomorrow night that I did today.  So I will. </p>
<p>I want a job.</p>
