<p>That was a fairly uneventful day.  I didn't get to work because the client fell off the face of the planet, but i would say that wasn't so bad.  I managed to read most of my book. </p>
<p>I went to a party tonight.  I never go to parties because well I honestly think they are boring and I am used to small parties which are not very private.  I have found that big parties allow for much more privacy.  Anyway I saw a bunch of people from high school, which was interesting to say the least.  I saw Dietrie for the first time pretty much since high school, that was cool.  </p>
<p>In other news, I got my timetable confirmation from the University up in Edmonton.  Which is excellent since that means I really get to go to classes once I am there.  (btw 11 days)</p>
<p>I don't have much more to say tonight. (like i ever really do)</p>
