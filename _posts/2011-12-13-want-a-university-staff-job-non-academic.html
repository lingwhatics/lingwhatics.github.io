<p>Good luck! (Unless you already work there, then you need it less.)</p>
<p>According to the University of Torontoâ€™s Human Resources &amp; Equity Annual Report 2010 (<a title="U of T HR &amp; Equity Annual Report 2010 [PDF]" href="https://www.hrandequity.utoronto.ca/Assets/reports/hre/2010.pdf" target="_blank">page 9 [PDF]</a>) there were 844 postings from 1 Oct 2009 and 30 Sept 2010 that received a total of 60,883 applications (average 72/posting). Of the 844 postings, 677 postings were filled, but the interesting part is that 58% (395) were internal candidates and 42% (282) were external candidates.</p>
<p>It also too a while to fill the postings, an average of 61 days with a median of 56 days. The report notes these are 10-18 days longer than filling similar job functions as reported by the Conference Board of Canada. Unless you want management then the time to fill is similar to the wider economy.</p>
<p>Just some thoughts when you see that university job posting of your dreams.</p>
