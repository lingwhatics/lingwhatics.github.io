<p class="flickr-yourcomment">Heather and I were on Queen Street on Saturday afternoon and found University closed for some protests in front of the US consulate. The  EMS support vehicles were just entering when we got there. The police officer seemed a little unhappy to be there and that all the cars weren't listening to him.</p>
