<p>Why does MSN suck so much? (I know that question answers itself in some respects but not absolutly every aspect.) I stand up to get some water and I get disconnected for an hour and a half. (still not connected yet.) Oh well I guess it is good since I will probably read more tonight and maybe even go to bed earlier.</p>
