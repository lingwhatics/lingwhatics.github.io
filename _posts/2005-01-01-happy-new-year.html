<p>Hello to all you out there. I got home a while ago from my New Year's partying. A bunch of us went to a movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375063/"><span style="font-style:italic;">Sideways</span></a>. It was pretty good; it had many funny sections. Then after that we went to Jasmine's to play games and we ended up watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241303/"><span style="font-style:italic;">Chocolat</span></a>. Also I go tmy digital camera and with great joy I opened it and started playing with it.<br />
<br /><span class="down" style="display:block;" id="formatbar_CreateLink" title="Link"></span><br />
<br />My resolutions are something like (not in a specific order):<br />

<ol>
<li>Watch less mindless TV.</li>
<li>Catch up on all the books that I probably should've read by now.</li>
<li>Be less wishy-washy when dealing with everything.</li>
<li>Work hard but with much relaxing</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, Happy New Year to all.</p>
