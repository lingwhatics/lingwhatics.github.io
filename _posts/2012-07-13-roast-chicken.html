<p>While out for a post-game drink last night, I came to think about the similarities of restaurants that serve chicken as their main menu item. This was not random thinking as we were at Swiss Chalet. Apart from the seating and the lighting, it was not all that different from the <a title="Norky’s" href="https://www.gruponorkys.com/" target="_blank">Norky’s</a> that we ate at in Lima. I am not sure where I was going with this... I guess it is interesting that the restaurant type exists all over.</p>
