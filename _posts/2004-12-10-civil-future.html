<p>This is what I want to be doing when I'm done.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Program:<br />
<br />Department of Civil Engineering<br />
<br /> This department within the Faculty of Engineering is being  rewarded for developing an innovative undergraduate design  course in 2002-03. In the course, 63 fourth-year Calgary  engineering students gained real-life, hands-on international  experience in Portugal working on design proposals for a  project related to Alta de Lisboa, the largest urban renewal  project in Europe. The students worked with the Portuguese  developer (Sociedade Gestora de Alta de Lisboa) on the highly  multidisciplinary, cross-cultural and challenging design  and management project. U of C engineering professors Dr.  Janaka Ruwanpura and Dr. Andrew MacIver managed the course,  which included more than 40 academic and industry advisers  from Calgary and Lisbon.</p></blockquote>
