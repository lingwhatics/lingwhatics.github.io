<p>It was really snowy earlier this week and the walk home was windy. My camera probably didn't like the cold. It did have a bit of frost on the screen when I was about halfway home but it took the photos and survived to shoot again.</p>
<p>This is about 3/4 of the way home. A small parkette just south of the Mount Pleasant Cemetery.</p>
