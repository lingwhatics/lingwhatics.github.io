<p class="flickr-yourcomment"> We are staying in a comfy hotel in a fairly central area of Barcelona. It is called "<a href="http://www.praktikhotels.com/">the Praktik</a>" and for the price I would say it delivers what it promises. The bed is very nice to sleep in. My sister will atest to this after she hosteled around Europe most of the last month.</p>
<p>The shower is great and not shared. We are off the side of the building and look out onto a small courtyard with the next building. There is a "lounge" with a deck and chairs for all to use. It was too sunny out the other day to use it (and by too sunny I mean too hot in the sun).</p>
<p>I would highly recommend this one for anybody staying in Barcelona who doesn't quite want a hostel.</p>
