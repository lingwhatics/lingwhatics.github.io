<p>SEARS doesn't install front-loading washers because the pipes might be old. Huh? Old pipes don't matter for top-loading ones, which the guy said he does install. Leveling was a pain because the floor is raised above where the washer is sitting. It would've been nice if the riser option would've fit below the cupboards.</p>
