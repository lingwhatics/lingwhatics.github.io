<h2> How do I avoid Hallowe'en? </h2>
<p>Of course I have nothing against Hallowe'en and I don't care if everybody else wants to get dressed up. And do whatever pleases them. But I don't see the appeal in going to a bar with tons of people in costume, not to say I have never gone.  </p>
<p>I guess what I am trying to say is why? Why? Why? what is the thing about the day?  I never quite understood. </p>
<p>No matter. I will thinking about something else, but i was on a roll there i hadn't thought about thinking myself out of doing stuff (Yes, it is kind of like talking one's self out of doing something but without saying anything out loud.) I'm sure the large audience knows what i am talking about and if you don't know it most likely won't cause you any grief.</p>
