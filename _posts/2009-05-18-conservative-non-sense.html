<p>If you watch the ad in the top right corner of <a href="http://ignatieff.me/?p=ignatieff#watch">this page</a>. You should listen with a different set of words.<br />
It starts the same... he's been away for 34 years.<br />
Michael Ignatieff has lived in a different country, do you want a leader who has been elsewhere in the world?</p>
<p>The ad basically sums up the Conservative position that to be Canadian being white and rich isn't enough... you also have to have lived here forever. It also helps that if you were born in Ontario that you move to Alberta and hope that nobody remembers you are from Ontario.</p>
<p>Finally, these ads aren't just playing politics. Politics is a gentleman's sport and the discourse in Canada these days would disqualify most if not all the players.</p>
