<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	Wednesday, we walked around various parts of the city.</p>
<p>Thursday, we got up and went to see Sagrada Familia. It was a fairly interesting building with a large "museum" area in the lower level. After, this we took my sister to the airport so she could go home. A long siesta followed before more night time exploring.</p>
