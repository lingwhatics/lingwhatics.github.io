<p>I don't remember the last time I went so many places on a Friday. Lectures were ok though it seems that nobody seems to know what is going on in Thermodynamics because the prof is telling us that arbitrarily cold will pass to a hot body and that you can harness this. Now, I don't remember the last time it was easy to capture large amounts of arbitrary processes.</p>
<p>After this I went down to the Glenbow to see the model buildings by Foster and Partner, who are going to be designing the EnCana building. This seems like a great thing because many of their buildings are energy efficient.</p>
<p>I met with Heather later and we had some nachos then went down to the zoo. We saw the little hippo. I think the keeper said he was 700 lbs. I took a bunch of pictures you can see them <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/dalmond/" rel="tag">here</a>. The butterfly house was really warm and smelled quite good. Then off we went to <a href="https://www.mec.ca" rel="tag">MEC</a> and to grab some food. The Uptown was our next stop and we saw <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0419294/" rel="tag"><span style="font-style:italic;">The Three Burials of Malquiades Estrada</span></a>. It was quite a good movie.</p>
<p>Following all that fun stuff. We met up with Jamie and Rhoda at Heather and watched <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0318462/" rel="tag">Motorcycle Diaries</a>.</span> And of course that was good too.</p>
<p>And that was really all. Well actually I rode the train a bunch and took a pile of pictures.</p>
