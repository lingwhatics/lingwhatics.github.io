<p>Alright so as you all know it is -35ish here. Lisa and I walked this morning to our first classes. She got to go to hers, but mine was cancelled. That class was the only reason I was leaving my house today, along with my Neurolinguistics quiz.</p>
<p>Anyway I got my final project form my syntax class back, and it was pretty good.</p>
<p>I hung out all afternoon and came home to clean up my roommates dinner. They had run out when they were mostly done to the Nickelback concert.</p>
<p>I think I will get to bed soon so that I can get to sleep before they get home.</p>
<p>Song: Let It Be - The Beatles, Forever - Ben Harper<br />
<br />State: Quite good, but tired.</p>
