<p class="flickr-yourcomment">This is the musical guest on Go! this morning, <a href="http://www.maplemusic.com/artists/ssi/default.asp">Steve Singh</a>, and he was great. On the way out we bought his two CDs. Though tonight we have only listened to one, which he played songs from on the show. Check him out if you have the chance.</p>
