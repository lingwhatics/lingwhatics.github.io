## Where am I?

Montr√©al, QC

## What am I doing?

- We took a trip to Calgary in September to visit my mum and my dad, and had planned to see friends. We didn't end up seeing many friends because my daughter tested positive for covid on the third day there. We had fun anyway doing our own thing away from others mostly, but will have to go again soon.
- Almost every weekend this summer, I got out biking with the family.
- I keep using duolingo for Spanish. Maybe one day I will speak to someone who isn't in my household.

## What's Next?

- Holidays and days off
- A trip somewhere in April or May
- Figuring out what I actually want to do (because it isn't really what I'm up to now)


Idea for this came from [Peter](https://ruk.ca/content/what-am-i-doing-now "What am I doing /now").
