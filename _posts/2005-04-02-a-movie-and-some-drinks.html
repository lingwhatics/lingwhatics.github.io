<p>Last night I went to see <span style="font-style:italic;">Bride &amp; Prejudice</span> at the Plaza Theatre. It was kind of corny but it was an amusing movie just the same. Then we went to Meghan's and drove around for a bit before getting slurpees and vodka. After which we went to Linds's to drink them and sat around chatting for a while.</p>
<p>It was a pretty good night. In contrast to a boring day at work where almost nothing happened. I painted some boxes that we have to sample drop off, and that was basically all. We went for lunch at a Vietnamese restaurant and it was pretty good.</p>
