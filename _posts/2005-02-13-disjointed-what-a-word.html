<p>It has been too long. I should have posted over the course of the week. Oh well it is too late now. Last week I got my first pay cheque from work which was nice though I only kind of like getting real cheques rather than direct deposit.</p>
<p>Really nothing interesting happened. I painted for my aunt this weekend and therefore my weekend was not relaxing at all. Tomorrow night I should read up in Engg Econ so that I am finally at the right place in the text, and know what is on the quiz this week. But the next two weekends I am going to do nothing stressful. Since it will be reading week. Though I will have to work for 4 days during reading week at the lab, but that's fun.</p>
<p>Last week flew by so fast at work on Thursday we were all thinking it was Tuesday, and then out of no where it was *BAM!* Friday.</p>
<p>Anyway, this disjointed post will come to an end now.</p>
