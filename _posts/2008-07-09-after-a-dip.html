<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	Saturday morning, we were up early for breakfast and headed out to Sandbanks Provincial Park. The beach was very nice. The sand was soft and the water wasn't too cold. However, the sun was too hot for my shoulder, which I inexplicably missed with sunscreen, but only the front of them not the back.</p>
<p>We had a nice drive around the area in the afternoon and got some goat cheese spread. After this it was nap time before I head out to map some more streets.</p>
