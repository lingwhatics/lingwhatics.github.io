<p class="flickr-yourcomment">Friday night was a party night. We had a grand time.</p>
<p>I had to get up early this morning to get to work, and I didn't get to ticket much because of an open house. There was a football game later in the afternoon, so it wasn't too long of a day.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I should get up to studying for my two midterms on Friday. One of my midterms is Friday afternoon when I normally don't have classes so I only have a short shift that day. It's a bit sad since I keep having shifts that I am shortening or losing. However, I'm doing fun things for the other shifts I'm losing.</p>
