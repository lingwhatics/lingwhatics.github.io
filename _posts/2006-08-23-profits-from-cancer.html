<p>This is an interesting story (<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2006/08/23/cancer-fundraising.html">Link</a>) and probably will be an interesting book about where money donated to breast cancer "research" goes. However, it is always good to check the fine print before donating to any organisation. Especially those like corporate donation drive, runs, walks and World Vision that have disproportionate operating costs and high paid directors.</p>
