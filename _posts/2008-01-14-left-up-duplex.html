<p>I was playing with my GorillaPod SLR that I got for Christmas from Heather's parents. I had thought about doing some shots from the balcony but hadn't gotten around to it yet. This is just one of the many I took.</p>
<p>I think I will try to set it up at a busier intersection or one with a shorter cycle so that I can get both directions. Unfortunately, from the balcony I get both the sides without advanced turns.</p>
<p>Anyway, enjoy the photos.</p>
