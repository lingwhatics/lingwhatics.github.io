I took a ride to give my keys to my lovely apartment back to my landlord (and I was a bit late because I had been enjoying peirogis). A bit sad to move out because it was a great apartment and I would've loved to keep living there but it just isn't the right size for two people. Afterward, I took a diversion through Vieux Montreal.

Total trip distance: 7.51 km

Moving time: 0h 28m
