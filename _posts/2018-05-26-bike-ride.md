Beautiful Saturday to get out riding. Today's adventure took me to Doors Open at R. C. Harris Water Treatment Works and the Toronto Archives. I also picked up the newest Jelly King (Pineapple Blueberry). Unfortunately, I had to cut my ride short and drop my bike off at the shop to get a broken spoke and a untrue wheel fixed.

Total trip distance: 30.1 km
