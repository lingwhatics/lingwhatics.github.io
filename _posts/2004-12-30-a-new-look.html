<p>I decided that I wanted to change my blog setup because the other template was simple and all that, but it wasn't pretty. So here is my new template with a few of my own changes, such as the red star in the corner rather than orange.</p>
<p>I haven't got my gmail account to work again yet so don't e-mail me there because I won't get it. Also, I still don't really know what I'm going to do tomorrow night, I think I might be going to a movie, but people were supposed to come watch a movie last night and they never came so who knows what will happen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went for lunch with Jamie at Harvey's and then we went on a little adventure to London Drugs to see if I could get a memory card for my digital camera, which I still don't have yet. I got a 512MB xD card for cheaper than I had seen it anywhere else. We also went into the computer/video part of the store and I decided to buy the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0333766/"><span style="font-style:italic;">Garden State</span></a> DVD to replace the copy of <a href="http://www.cornergas.com/"><span style="font-style:italic;">Corner Gas: Season 1</span></a> that my sister gave me for Christmas since my dad also got it for me.</p>
<p>Songs: Man on the Moon - REM, Chop Suey - System of a Down<br />
<br />Book: The Catcher in the Rye - Salinger, J. D.<br /></p>
