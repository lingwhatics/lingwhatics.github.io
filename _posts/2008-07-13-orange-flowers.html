<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	Friday night, Heather and I went out for a walk towards Lawrence so that I could map the area and get all the street names. Along the way, we stopped in Alexander Muir Park. It was a quite green and the plants were all colourful. I suppose it helps that it hasn't been obscenely hot this summer.</p>
