<p>I have been doing some homework tonight. I had a couple of design things to get done and still have a couple of drawings for that class. Many of the sites posted by the drawing instructor are quite cool. Recently, we have had a lecture on biomimetics, which is mimicking biological structures as the name suggests.  It was quite neat, so many cool designs. Some how this lecture produced the following <a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/antenna/building/energy/131.asp">link</a>, among others. It discusses a neat idea for reducing energy consumption.</p>
<p>Apart from that,  I have a midterm on  Thursday morning and a presentation in the afternoon. I really hope those go well because well, I want them to.  There are 3 work shifts to work after that and a fun Roughnecks game on Saturday night. Yay!</p>
<p>I think that shall be all for now because I should get to bed.</p>
