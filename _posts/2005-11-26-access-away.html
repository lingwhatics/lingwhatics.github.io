<p>I spent four hours yesterday in the Civil computer lab. It was a thrill. However, I am very nearly done my Access assignment. It was time well spent. I also helped a few other people start on their way, but I'm sure they will be in the lab all weekend slogging through it. This week I have spent so much time sitting in front of Access getting nowhere. Oh well, it is basically done now. On to circuits, which is half done.</p>
<p>Last weekend I bought a new squash racquet, but I think I said that already. It was nice to play with much nicer than the old ones.</p>
<p>Last night, my sister and I went to Heather's for nachos and empanadas. It was a good dinner. Then the three of us went to Eau Claire to see RENT. It was pretty good.</p>
