<p>So yesterday I finally delivered a finished product to my supervisor from the summer. It was nice to be done. He told me that I had done a very good job and that I seemed to have a knack for research. Also, to go talk to them (the professors, I guess) if I was interested in doing any research over the course of the year, since there is always something that can be done. I was also told that the best time to get a Masters is right after finishing the engineering degree since most people don't want to leave their job to go back to school. With a Masters, I can get a better job when I start working rather than working up to it over, certainly, more than 2 years.</p>
<p>It was good. Quite nice  to be appreciated at work. In other work news, I got my new boots (shoes, really) from the other job yesterday also. They are nice Merrell ones that are waterproof and I think the top of them sort of look like skater shoes.</p>
<p>I'm not really sure what else to say at the moment so I will head to bed. Have a good weekend.</p>
