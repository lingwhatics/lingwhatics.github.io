<p>So it seems that I haven't really been writing much. I suppose it is mostly because I don't have much to talk about. I haven't been doing all that much. Though, when I think about it it seems like lots of stuff.</p>
<p>My airport passenger modeling is coming along nicely. I am having a bit of trouble making it simple for the end-user, since I already understand what everything does. So, I am sort of slogging through that. I'm hoping that it will be done in the next day or two. Then I can move on to the next step, in the week and a bit that I have left in this research award. Of course, if I'm not done I will probably just keep working on the thing until I am because why leave a project almost done just because you didn't finish it in the arbitrary time limit.</p>
<p>The other day, I found out that there was a different prof teaching ENCI 413 this year. I don't know if this is a good thing or not. I liked the prof who was originally teaching it. She was the one who made me aware of the NSERC award that has filled my summer. I haven't really heard anything (good or bad) about the new prof, but I'm sure people in my class have some source of negative comment. That just seems to be the way.</p>
<p>Today, somebody asked me if they could use a photo for some article they were working on. So I said that it would be fine. What else... Oh this afternoon I went to the airport for the third time in 3 weeks. It was to pick up my cousin who is visiting for the week. I plan to continue this airport going trend, as I am going to Toronto on the 26th and returning on the 2nd. So that will be 5 weeks in a row that I will have been at the Calgary Airport. I don't know why this is really of note. I like the smell of the airport because it seems new and old at the same time.</p>
