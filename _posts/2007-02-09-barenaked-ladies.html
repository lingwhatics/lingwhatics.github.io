<p>Just got home from the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Barenaked</span> Ladies concert at the 'dome. It was so much fun. Sitting... well standing... in the 12<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span> row on the floor was great. There were some really crazy girls in front of us and these hilarious dancing guys up in the stands. They seemed to be mimicking each other.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was great. I didn't take a camera though which was too bad but everybody seemed to use their cellphones for that purpose and basically nobody had real digital cameras. During "If I Had a Million Dollars" somebody threw some boxes of Kraft Dinner on the stage and Steve's eyes were really surprised looking. He proceeded to read the nutritional information on the box.</p>
<p>Great time.</p>
