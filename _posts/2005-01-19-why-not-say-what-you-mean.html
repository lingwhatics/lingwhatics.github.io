<p>"I'll call you if I feel that I need to talk to somebody who I don't really care about, but I haven't felt like that for a long time so your day won't be today." That's really what people should have on their answering machines because that's what they mean. I know some people are busy and might not have time, but don't say by the end of business hours if you don't mean it.</p>
<p>I got an e-mail today from somebody and it reminded me of how I managed to ruin that friendship and others. It just seems that I can't talk to people and maintain a reasonable rapport with them in the long term. I guess, I'm doomed to ruin all things with all people. So watch out if I haven't ruined anything yet.</p>
<p>Looking for a job seems pointless because it appears doomed to end with me having to work at the same place I worked all summer and it wasn't that I hated working there so much as I hated making $7.50/hr when other people I know were making $15/hr and getting full-time hours. Yea, I got full time equivalent hours only the last week I worked there and guess what I worked all 7 of the days that week. That was the only way I got full-time. That's just stupid for a job that suggested that it was full-time. It should've been advertised as being part-time that's about how many hours we usually got. And the people who worked slowly on purpose didn't get punished for doing so, but the people who were usually good workers got in trouble when they didn't work as hard as usual.</p>
<p>I don't care if that's how it is in the "real" world of working. That just doesn't sit with me, I would've turfed those people the first time I noticed that they were working slowly to take more time.</p>
<p>One of the things that has bugged me for the last few days is those companies that don't accept applications in person anymore because everything has to go through HR. Wouldn't want anything funny to happen when applications are submitted. The sites that you must use to apply are worse than registering for classes by telephone, which I only did for one class to see how it was. It was one of the most painful experiences I have had on the phone. A bit more than trying to get the TELUS voice-"recognizing" phone system to understand what you really want. Somehow I find it hard to believe that "Internet" is different from "the Internet", but the first leads to long-distance and the second to Internet. One company that took forever to apply to was London Drugs. I understand their desire for all applications to be uniform but they really didn't have to use slow software from PeopleSoft. For those who know, it was slower than BearTracks which is a very similar product from the same company.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the aspect of getting everybody's 2 cents (times 50) about where would be a good place to apply. Really would it be a good place, that's great who should I talk to there. Oh just give my resume to the main desk... Let me think... Um... NO! That is just a waste of my time because my resume will leave the desk only in a bin headed for the shredder.</p>
<p>I imagine that most of you don't care to talk to me and that is fine because you probably wouldn't want to bother with me if I hadn't written this anyhow so that's all for now.</p>
