<p class="flickr-yourcomment">There were many signs indicating that we should feed the chipmunks nuts or seeds. There were some feeders around so we took some peanuts and seeds out to feed. The chipmunks came to eat out of the hand quickly. I have a movie of Heather feeding one and, eventually, I will post it somewhere.</p>
