<p>My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/337702997">5 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>This book is a wonderful look at the many parts of how creativity works. It explores how many of the “common sense” ideas about creativity are backwards, and instead of leading to more creativity do the opposite. As with his other books, Jonah Lehrer spins interesting stories and studies together to make a compelling read.</p>
