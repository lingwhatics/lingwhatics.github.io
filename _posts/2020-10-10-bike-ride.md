One more nice day for a ride. Down to Verdun, up through LaSalle and back toward home on many new streets. I even took the pedestrian/cycle path in the Saint-RÃ©mi tunnel.

Total trip distance: 15.59 km

Moving time: 0h 57m

Zoomed in image with a couple new streets which were filled with auto shops up near the aquaduct and water treatment plant.
