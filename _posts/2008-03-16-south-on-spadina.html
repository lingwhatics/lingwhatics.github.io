<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	Saturday, we went to the ROM to see a new exhibit about Darwin. It was neat though too many people since it was the end of March break. Afterwards, we walked to Spadina and took the streetcar down to MEC.</p>
<p>We both got some new sunglasses and then went for delicious lunch at Rivoli. After all this, I bought a tablet for my computer. Not sure what for, so far I have started drawing random things in photoshop.</p>
