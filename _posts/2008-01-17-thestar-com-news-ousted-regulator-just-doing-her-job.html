<p><a href="http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/294886">TheStar.com | News | Ousted regulator just doing her job</a><br />This is an unacceptable use of priministerial power and Stephen Harper should at very least force Lunn to resign if not resign himself. In the end we are going to have to pay a very very expensive severance to Keen (who will deserve it after this mess) all because she rubbed the Harper the wrong way by doing her job properly.</p>
