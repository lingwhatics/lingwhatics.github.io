<p>First of all I don't understand why Blogger insists on setting the time to 1am when it is 12 am but puts the right hour for all other times including noon that I blog.</p>
<p>Anyway, today was a rather lazy day. I got up shoveled the driveway and sidewalk, played Freecell and read. It wasn't too bad, except that I am starting to get annoyed with having to sit on my floor to use my computer.</p>
<p>The other night when I was being driven home, by an individual who I won't name because everybody knows who it is, the driver used her signal two times and one time was to change into a lane that didn't really exist. Also, she stopped fully at about 1 stop sign out of probably 7. And they say that young males are the worst drivers. I'm sure it's been proven that young women are worse, and it's just that young males get in more serious accidents. I remember reading that young women driver are in more accidents percentage-wise than young males.</p>
<p><a name="speak"> </a>I suppose I will write something about my comment on Heather's plane companion of the seat behind. I don't really mean to sound mean or anything but it's a reflection on most parents if their kids are disturbing those around them. Disturbing people in a mall is one thing but in a plane it is completely different since you can't just choose to move to another spot.</p>
<p>The game President or Asshole, whatever you choose to call it, has to be the stupidest card game there is. Mostly because everybody knows how to play it and therefore when nobody knows what to do they play it. I can't stand the game and don't see why I have to join in. If other people don't want to play games that the rest of the people want to then they can just not join in; they can watch. I don't really see why I should have to play it.</p>
<p>I think that's it for now. Except for this link to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_salad">Fruit Salad</a>.</p>
