<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	I'm done my exams. Finally. On the same day I finished I got my first unofficial mark. I got somewhere in the A- range in Hydrogeology. It is excellent. I usually enjoyed that class and am glad that I pulled that one out. I have two more days of work this year: Friday and Saturday. After that, I have 4 days before heading off to Toronto for two weeks of fun times.</p>
