<p>Hey all I was surfing tonight and found this horribly funny invention-- <a href="http://www.8trackheaven.com/horseophonic.htm">Horse mounted 8-track player</a>.</p>
<p>And the second thing was from Jamie's Blog which is about marriage but could be used as an argument against the sanctity of said "institution". <a href="http://www.sourlime.net/index.php?p=225&amp;more=1&amp;c=1">Marriage thing</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I ate chili fudge pie for dinner tonight and though it sounds gross it was really really good.</p>
