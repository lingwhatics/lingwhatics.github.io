<p>Heather's brother took us to see the new Second City show, Facebook of Revelations. It was quite funny. Her brother even participated in the show as a "caller" on one of the sketches. It was really funny. They explained how to fix a growth on your toe using "Smokey and the Bandit". Hilarious show.</p>
<p>Tonight we watched the final episode of "Second City's Next Comedy Legend". It has been one of the better reality shows I have actually watched. Very funny and mostly not painful to watch. The final 3 were all really funny.</p>
