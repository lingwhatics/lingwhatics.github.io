<p class="flickr-yourcomment">Two weeks ago, we headed down to a ravine so I could do an assignment for a course. The assignment was to observe a water system and think about how to model it. It was kind of fun.</p>
<p>The ravine was snowy and the trees were dripping water on us most of the time. Glad I went that weekend because it is raining and is very windy this weekend.</p>
