<p>Another weekend is gone and it was fun. Though I didn't accomplish much in the way of finishing my essay, but I'm not worried because I get an extra week for my Sociolinguistics paper.</p>
<p>So Friday afternoon Heather and I went to see <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>, and it was really good. Oh and we watched <em>To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar</em>... What a good movie.</p>
<p>What else... Oh yea, watched a bunch of basketball. Almost every team I picked to win didn't. A few of them almost did. UConn did win, so one pick in the 4 is not bad.</p>
<p>I think I have started to just randomly talk to people, which is good but not very useful since I don't have much time left in this year. So I won't really meet lots of people with my new found desire to talk to people...</p>
