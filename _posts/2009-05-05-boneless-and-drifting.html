From the zoo on Sunday.</p>
<p>Slowly moving to a new apartment. Will be done Saturday when the bed and shelves get moved, and I guess the TV and kitchen stuff too.</p>
<p>Waiting on marks; somehow got a B+ in the group project, which is pretty good considering our midterm grade. I think I got an A- in ethics. That's what I should get based on the course outline, but I wouldn't complain if it were an A.</p>
<p>After moving and waiting for grades, I figure I will read some books before going back to Calgary. I finished <span style="font-style:italic;">Our Man in Havana</span> last night. It was quite enjoyable. I have a few books that I brought or else a textbook to read, and I'll <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">probably</span> get through all of them.</p>

Taken near the Leslie St Spit.</p>
