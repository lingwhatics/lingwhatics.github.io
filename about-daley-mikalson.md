This is Daley's blog. I have merged my coding blog and my normal one, but I still plan to post here about fun coding activities and random things that I am trying to learn. By day, I manage projects to help my teams do amazing work together that they couldn't do on their own. By night, I get to tinkering on the computer or reading a book after the baby goes to sleep.
