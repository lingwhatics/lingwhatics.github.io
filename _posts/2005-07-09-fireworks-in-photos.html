<p><a href="https://photos23.flickr.com/24749509_07ee375f92_m.jpg"><img src="https://photos23.flickr.com/24749509_07ee375f92_m.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />I have uploaded a bunch of my photos from the Grandstand show on Thursday night. Much of the show I didn't care for, but the fireworks and the gymnastics were excellent.</p>
<p>I'm not really sure how people go down to the Stampede more than once and hang around all day walking the grounds. I really just don't see that much stuff there. I mean I have been like that last million years but I am just not sure about the attraction of the place. Oh well.</p>
<p>This last week I started working at the Mount Royal College book store again. It seems like it will be enjoyable. A basically straight-forward job. Unpacking books and shelving them, hopefully, in the right place.</p>
<p>Friday morning, I watched the Stampede parade on CFCN because I really didn't feel like getting up. Then I spent much of the rest of the day doing nothing. Heather and I went to Market Mall, I talked to Mel there, and we got some stuff to eat for dinner. Later, we watched TV with Rhoda.</p>
<p>Wednesday, I went to see <span style="font-style:italic;">Ladies in Lavender</span> with Steph, Pat and Rhoda. It wasn't really my type of movie but it was a good movie. I much preferred the last two movies I saw downtown. Oh, in the preview of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mad Hot Ballroom</span> that they played before the film, there was this song that I really wanted but I have no clue what it is called because I don't recall it from the movie. It is a song with a voice saying moves to a dance... well maybe not a specific dance, and it is set to a cool beat.</p>
<p>I spent a long time last night, well maybe it would be considered this morning, playing around with settings on Heather's wireless router that I borrowed so that my sister could use the Airport on her new iBook. It took forever, and I looked on the Apple Discussion forums and it would seem that many people had trouble with the LinkSys router and most of them couldn't resolve it. I managed to, though I really have no clue what it is that I changed. It could've been the MAC address filtering though that doesn't really make sense because Jamie's D-Link let me set up her iBook with filtering on and it continued to work. I guess it really doesn't matter because it is working now.</p>
<p>It sounds like it wants to rain or thunder storm, and there is a cold breeze coming into my window. I think I shall go check that out.</p>
<p>Song: Chancellor - Gordon Downie, Quel Rico el Mambo from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Motorcycle Diaries</span> soundtrack<br />Book: <span style="font-style:italic;">The Economist</span> from this previous week</p>
