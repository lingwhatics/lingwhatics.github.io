<p>I haven't accomplished much this week after spending much of last week working in the computer lab. Oh well, I will have to write my part of a group project tomorrow because it has to be compiled this weekend. I still can't believe it is almost the end of the semester.</p>
<p>Today, Micki's MSN name was "Let's all get gay married". I'm not sure why it was this but it was amusing.</p>
<p>Yea I think that's it.</p>
