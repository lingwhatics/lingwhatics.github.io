<br />You are green.  Perhaps one of the most balanced of<br />
<br />all the colors.  By balanced, I mean balanced<br />
<br />in both bad and good parts.  Let me elaborate:<br />
<br />You're a natural, and somewhat superficial<br />
<br />person.  You're extremely generous, but, to add<br />
<br />to the confusion, you're frugal and stingy.<br />
<br />You're a forgiving, but jealous person.  You're<br />
<br />imaginative, but still logical.  At sometimes,<br />
<br />you're a complete neat-freak, and other times,<br />
<br />you're a total slob.  You're very stable, but<br />
<br />undependable.  But onto the other traits that<br />
<br />are associated with this color...  You're a<br />
<br />stubborn person, simply put.  Do you believe in<br />
<br />Feng Shui?  Green is closely related to the<br />
<br />thought of having a balanced environment, you<br />
<br />know.  When in a bad situation, you're<br />
<br />painfully pessimistic, and when you're in a<br />
<br />good situation, you're extremely optimistic.  A<br />
<br />fairly outgoing and amused person, you enjoy<br />
<br />talking to people, and hearing their thoughts<br />
<br />on different things.  As a plus, when people<br />
<br />hang around you, it seems like time passes by<br />
<br />all the more quickly.</p>
