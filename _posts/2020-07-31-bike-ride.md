Afternoon ride after a tense morning where my company was letting go of a lot of staff but luckily I was not one of them. I went for a ride west from my place and ended up in Verdun when my back wheel decided the nut holding it in place was not tight enough and it should move thereby putting the tire right against the frame. It wouldn't turn anymore. I had to walk it to the nearest bike show where they do not do repairs without an appointment (not useful and really fits the snooty bike shop persona). 

Again lucky for me there were bike repair tools in the park across the street. I loosened my wheel and realigned it just before the bike fell off the stand taking a bunch of my index finger skin with it. I finished the repair, washed my bloody finger down with my water bottle and continued on my ride. I stopped at the hardware store for screws to fix my dishwasher and the beer shop to pick up an order.

Overall, I felt like it was a good ride despite the bike repair and the finger damage.

Total trip distance: 17.11 km

Moving time: 1h 12m
