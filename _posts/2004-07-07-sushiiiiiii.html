<p>Alright so I was reading I don't know what last night... I think it was <i>As the Apple Turns</i> anyway... There was this link to <a href="https://www.twinkies.com/frameset.asp?goto=recipebox&amp;gotoContent=RecipesClare.asp?id=84">Twinkie Sushi</a>, which was only sort of disturbing.</p>
<p>Today I went over to my aunt's and painted. I am almost finished, all I have to do is some base boards and some door frames.</p>
<p>I'm thirsty...</p>
<p>Book: None right now... or but I have an Economist I should read.</p>
