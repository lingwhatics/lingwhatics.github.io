I sold my car a couple weeks ago and while going through all the papers and files, I decided that I should look at all the costs. It was a surprising exercise because the costs were higher than I expected even when ignoring the purchase price.

The full analysis is available on GitHub [Mazda3 Analysis](https://github.com/lingwhatics/car/blob/master/mazda3Analysis.md "Mazda3 Analysis"). I used this as an opportunity to checkout the RMarkdown format and all that comes with that.
