<p class="flickr-yourcomment">Last weekend in the wind, we walked along Lake Shore out to Leslie. It was a pretty nice walk. Next time, I'd go for a bike ride out there and then perhaps down the spit.</p>
<p>This weekend was mostly at home working on a project and studying for my first exam on Wednesday. I hope next weekend is as nice as this one and I can get out and enjoying it more.</p>
