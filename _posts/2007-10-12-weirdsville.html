<p><a href="http://www.weirdsville-the-movie.com/"><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Weirdsville</span> The Movie - Official Site</a><br />This is a funny movie and you should all go see it. It may seem strange in the preview but it is totally worth it. And it is Canadian, but don't tell anyone because they won't want to go.</p>
