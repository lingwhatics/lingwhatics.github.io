<p><a href="https://www.thestar.com/News/Ontario/article/289297"><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">TheStar</span>.com | Ontario | <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Fantino</span> baffled by drinking, driving attitudes</a><br />This is an interesting story, but it leaves me with a question...</p>
<p>Is a 12 hour suspension long enough?</p>
<p>For going 50 km/h over the posted limit you get a week suspension, your car impounded for a week and a minimum $2000 fine, but drinking and driving 12 hours. I am all for losing your licence at 50 over even a 30 over you should but drinking and driving should be an automatic 30 day suspension. I don't care if you drive for a living or take 3 hours to get to work on transit... take a taxi... when you are suspended and when you have been drinking. It should be cheaper to take a taxi than take the chance.</p>
