<p>Well Happy New Year. I think that is what I'm supposed to say at this point.</p>
<p>I have been quite busy since Heather got back on Thursday morning. First, we went shopping after her plane eventually arrive late. They had trouble loading the plane at the beginning and so were late arriving in Calgary. But that didn't much matter. We went on an adventure of sorts after that. We went shopping. We didn't get anything exciting, but it was a good time. Some of the stores we went in looked a bit picked over, of note was EB Games which looked just empty.</p>
<p>Thursday night (or Friday morning, depending on how you look at it) I went off to BestBuy to sit outside and line up for a Wii. I was there for a long time but it was totally worth it. Wii is so much fun. Who would've imagined, though I guess I would've had to have some inkling to make me sit out in -15 C for 7.5 hours to get one. I did return one of the games I bought and some extra cables a couple days later and sadly that saved me $115.</p>
<p>Friday, I really have no clue what we did. I think we went to Heather's and played Wii and went to be sort of early because I had slept all of 7 hours in the previous 48. Oh we also went out for lunch with my family at Moxie's downtown. Good sandwiches.</p>
<p>Saturday, we went to my dad's family Christmas. It was fun. I had seen most people there a couple months ago. Unlike the usual year between times. In the evening, we went grocery shopping for Heather and to BestBuy for me to return a couple things.</p>
<p>Sunday, we got up late and hung around my house for long enough to shower and eat breakfast before heading down to Heather's. We had coffee with Lisa. And then we didn't really do much. I think we were a bit tired from all the days before and watched some TV shows and went to bed around one, after celebrating a new year. Though I think Heather was dozing a bit before midnight up until the TV was turned off.</p>
<p>Today, we played Wii and went out for a walk. It was a nice walk. In Rogers, Heather found a copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">Thank You for Smoking</span> for cheap and got that. We watched it this evening over grilled cheese and delicious orange. I'm so glad it is orange season because they are soo sooooo good.</p>
<p>That's all for now. I don't work until Saturday, so I'm sure I will write about something exciting this week.</p>
