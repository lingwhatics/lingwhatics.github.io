<p>It is like a blank canvas that I have to write on, but I am not really a writer.  I am not really funny on here either. Sarcasm loses all of its use once writing is involved, and although I wish I were just funny I feel it is sarcasm that is the base of any humour I produce. </p>
<p>In other news I got my subscription to the Globe and Mail today. And I didn't do anything I wanted to do today, except read my book.</p>
