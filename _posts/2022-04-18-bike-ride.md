Easter Monday family ride. A sunny afternoon so we took to the path along the Lachine Canal. It was not as windy as many of my trips along the canal have been, but it was busy with a lot of people walking in every area where the path gets narrower (somehow). 

Total trip distance: 10.17 km

Moving time: 0h 49m

Today's ride:
