<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	For those who don't know, it is still cold out. It is getting warmer next week but right now it is cold. But it is sunny now so that is much nicer. </p>
<p>This tree is in front of the heating plant at the university. The exhaust from the plant drifts over sometimes looking more like a mist that makes it to the ground. Other times going up up and away.</p>
<p>I intend to take a better photo tomorrow while at work. But this is what you can do with a camera phone. Not too bad.</p>
