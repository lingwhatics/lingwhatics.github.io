<p class="flickr-yourcomment">Had a busy weekend. Saturday, we had a nice walk down along Wellesley. Then Sunday, we had a bike ride down to Cherry Beach and the along a bike path to Tommy Thompson Park.</p>
<p>Thinking about reviving this blog on a more regular basis. We'll see if that happens</p>
