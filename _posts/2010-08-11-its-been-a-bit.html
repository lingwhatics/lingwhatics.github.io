<p>So I have been a bit delinquent in posting anything for the past 10 days or so. I have finished a few things and done some other stuff. I know quite specific. The long weekend was pretty calm. We went up to Owen Sound to see my sister and get some farm fresh veggies. On the way, we passed this Ferris wheel on one of the slow stretches as we approached a town or a traffic light.</p>

<p>We got to see my sister community garden plot. It is quite large and she is growing many types of veggies (tomato, carrot, pumpkin, peas, lettuce, Swiss char, various herbs, sunflowers, broccoli, onions, etc.). She also has some Mexican sunflowers, which she is standing behind in this photo picking pea pods (I think).</p>

<p>The rest of the weekend, we hung around Toronto. Heather had to work on Monday so I got some reading done and walked around. This past weekend was also quiet. We watched <em>Canadian Bacon</em>, which I had recorded from TV at some point, took a walk in the ravine nearby, had a lovely dinner at Victory Cafe (once it finally arrived), and made falafels.</p>
<p>I read a book, by Joseph Heath, called <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Filthy-Lucre-Joseph-Heath/dp/1554683955">Filthy Lucre: Economics for people who hate capitalism</a>, and it was an enjoyable collection of ideas. The premise was to point out fallacies that are presented by those on both the right and left of the political spectrum to support their particular way of thinking. It succeeded in pointing out several ideas that have bothered me and some that hadn't occurred to me.</p>
<p>This weekend will be just as exciting too. I'm writing my Engineering Professional Practice and Ethics exam. Thankfully, I have read the books and have gone through many of my notes. Also, my thesis project has a direction and should be progressing more quickly now.</p>
<p>Book: <em>Post Office</em> by Charles Bukowski</p>
