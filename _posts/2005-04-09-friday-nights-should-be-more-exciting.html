<p>Last night was a night of time passing so so fast. I got home at 5-ish and then suddenly it was 6.15 and I made a pizza. Then *BAM!!* it was like 8, I got a free desk, swivel chair, phone and bulletin board after pizza and before 8. I think it was about ten when I took my brother's friend home. And then I found that it was about 12.40 and I had finished hooking up the phone jack in my room.</p>
<p>Oh, I have been called to go to TimberTown so I must do that. I'm off.</p>
