<p>That midterm was by far the best one this semester. There were only two little parts with a point or two each that I wasn't sure I did it correctly. Though, for one of them I'm thinking that I did.</p>
<p>I don't really know what else I have to talk about... I'm going to the Flames game against Chicago on the 18th. I'm almost finish my book, I have about 15 pages left. I think next I will read <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385503865/qid=1130990242/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i2_xgl14/701-5925460-6789104"><span style="font-style:italic;">The Wisdom of Crowds</span></a> by James Surowiecki.</p>
