<p>This morning I had to get up at 7 so that I could have a shower before I drove my sister to the dentist for 8 and then came home to read and play playstation for a couple hours before going to work temporarily at the Mount Royal bookstore. Working at the bookstore was pretty good. Jamie was training me to do a bunch of things and then we went to the city centre campus to do a book sale.</p>
<p>Later we went for some good food at the little cafe on 8th Street then came to my house to continue our game of <span style="font-style:italic;">Simpsons RoadRage</span> on PS2 and watch <span style="font-style:italic;">Corner Gas</span>. Anyway, I should get to bed as I have to work in the morning.<br /></p>
