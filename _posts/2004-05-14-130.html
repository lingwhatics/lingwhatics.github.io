<p>I am back... In more than one sense. I am posting again and I am in Calgary. I flew in yesterday morning on a Skyservice plane which was awful. The plane wasn't bad, but it was such a scam I think 3/4 of the people getting on the plane had to pay for excess baggage which was charged at a rate of $7/kg. Which essentially makes your ticket $40+ more than it was originally. The flight itself was not too bad. The movie <em>In the Cut</em> was pretty good until it got to the sappy all movies need a happy ending part.</p>
<p>I also had my first Spanish class last night at the U of C. It was pretty good. It seems like it will last forever because it is 4 hours 2 nights a week but 4 hours (really 3 and a half) doesn't actually take that long.</p>
<p>What else... I don't know really right now.</p>
<p>Song: Mr Blue Sky - Electric Light Orchestra<br />
<br />State: Good but not yet employed<br />
<br />Book: This book Jasmine lent me.</p>
