<p>I can't believe that it is Friday already. I really don't feel like anything happened this week. Except that I know I had work to do and finally fixed my resume yesterday. It is all pretty now, thanks to Heather and my mum.</p>
<p>I don't really have that much to write about. I did post a bunch of photos on my Flickr site. Hopefully y'all will look at them.</p>
