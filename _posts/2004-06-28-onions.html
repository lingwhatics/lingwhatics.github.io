<p>I decided as you probably have already noticed to change my blog up a bit. It isn't quite perfect yet but it will be in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>Now with that stating of the obvious out of the way we can move on to more important things, like I have no clue what. I went out last night with my dad and brother. We were planning on seeing <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332452/">Troy</a></i>, but when we got to the theatre about 30 minutes before the movie was to start it and all others except one were sold out. Unfortunately, the only one that wasn't sold out was <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381707/">White Chicks</a></i>, which we didn't want to see. So we went back to my dad's and watched <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141926/">U-571</a></i>, which was actually not too bad.</p>
<p>Tonight, I went over to Jasmine's and I rented <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381707/">Bloody Sunday</a></i>. That was a really good movie, but a spot depressing. Also, I have decided that I don't feel like finishing my book because it is just dragging on. I think I am going to start <i>The Day of the Triffids</i> by John Wyndham. Of course that won't be until tomorrow after my exam while I am watching the election results. I really hope they aren't as ambiguous as they are looking to be, but I don't want to get into that.</p>
