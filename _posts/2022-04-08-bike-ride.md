I picked up my new Yuba Kombi today and rode it down toward home. It was a smooth ride adjusting to the new bike, hearing its noises and figuring out how to best use the gears. It should be a good summer of rides. I even took advantage of the gentler rise of La Gaucheti√®re to avoid going up a steeper hill on the first ride.

Total trip distance: 8.91 km

Moving time: 0h 38m
