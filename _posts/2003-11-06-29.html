<p>It was quite nice out today, and I got almost all the work done that I wanted to. Mind I could get a bit more done still. I could really finish reading that article that I started earlier.  </p>
<p>I don't think that I want to take French anymore it just isn't what I wanted it to be.  I almost want to take another language. Problem being I can only take 1 more intro course which causes me a bit of trouble.  </p>
<p>Girls... aren't they just a difficulty. Oh well I'll get over it.</p>
