<p><img src="http://images.quizilla.com/S/Sc0tty/1063071353_tureswater.jpg" border="0" alt="Water" /><br />You are water. You're not really organic; you're<br />neither acidic nor basic, yet you're an acid<br />and a base at the same time. You're strong<br />willed and opinionated, but relaxed and ready<br />to flow. So while you often seem worthless,<br />without you, everything would just not work.<br />People should definitely drink more of you<br />every day.</p>

<p>Alright so quizzes are silly little things, but I justlike what I got today. It made my week good, again.</p>
<p>I think I will get to bed since I should really do a bunch of work tomorrow.</p>
