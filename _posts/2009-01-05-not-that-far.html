<p class="flickr-yourcomment">I went for a walk along Unwin Avenue this afternoon. After almost getting my foot wet in the ditch beside the tracks, I continued on my walk down the tracks towards the stack at the end. I did get a large amount of mud on the back of my shoe but thankfully only on the outside.</p>
<p>Almost the whole way down, on the left side, are places to get salt. So many dump trucks passed me. On the right side, there are sports fields, a urban forestry office and a municipal property with no trespassing signs. I think they are storing snow in the no entry area.</p>
<p>I had to turn around when I got to the stack, which is part of the Hearn Generating Station, because the bridge further on is apparently closed. I didn't want to walk all that way to find out since there was no other way out except back.</p>
