<p>I am sitting here with my Sociolinguistics book in front of me and I can't read it. It is just to boring and the prof went through the text book in class. So, I don't really need to read it since it has been essentially read to me.</p>
<p>I  have a Spanish exam tomorrow and I am not worried about it. The only thing is that I don't know exactly what to expect for the exam since I didn't take the class last semester, and almost everybody else in the class did, with the same prof. Oh well... I will survive this exam.</p>
