<p>Today was uneventful. I had planned to go to the university and play squash but that didn't happen. I basically listened to music all day and played FreeCell and read online things.</p>
<p>I went for dinner with my siblings at Boston Pizza. It was pretty good. We had Rolo ice cream cake for dessert and that was as good as we had expected it to be. Later on Jamie, Linds and I watched some <span style="font-style:italic;">Family Guy</span> episodes and the pilot for <span style="font-style:italic;">Seinfeld</span>. All of which were quite funny.</p>
<p>I might make it to the squash court or bouldering wall tomorrow but it is really hard to say when I will actually get out of bed and go out into the world. I understand that it is going to be 11 degrees here tomorrow and that is great since there was this fake snow thing happening today where it doesn't ever hit the ground yet accumulates on all other surfaces especially car windows, trees and people's jackets.</p>
<p>Oh I almost forgot... I got a job today. I get to start February 1 or January 31, that part was unclear, but I get to work just the same. It's great since I already know how to do much of what I think I am supposed to be doing.</p>
