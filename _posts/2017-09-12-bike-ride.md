I haven't posted several commuting/errand rides and am trying to figure out a good way to display all my rides without individual posts for every day.

Today's ride took me to The Beaches and while I have ridden there many times, I have not ridden there since the City's bike app came out. The lake is still high, but the beach in the east seems larger than over by the Humber. I stopped for lunch at Aft Kitchen & Bar and it was delicious.

Total trip distance: 18.1 km.
