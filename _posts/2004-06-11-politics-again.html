<p>Well I was reading the <i>Herald</i> this morning because well I don't get the <i>Globe and Mail</i> during the week and there was a really good editorial by a UofC student. (I know who knew they could write.)  Anyway he's in Calgary-West riding where Rob Anders is running for the third time and they want him out. <a href="https://www.voteoutanders.com">Here</a> is the site indexed in the article. So all you people in Silver Springs get out there and vote him out.</p>
<p>And another blow against the <a href="https://www.conservative.ca/">Conservatives</a> should be this article by <a href="https://www.ctv.ca">CTV</a> from mayors of Canada warning against the lack of Conservative policy regarding cities. <a href="https://sympaticomsn.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1086959335928_6?hub=topstories">LINK</a></p>
<p>Well back to me... I was originally posting for the info of those in my own riding of Calgary-North Centre. The following link is from the G&amp;M site and if you click on each of the candidates's names you can get a short bio of them. <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/elections/fed2004/ridings/generated/48003.html">LINK</a> Let's do all we can to stop Jim Prentice from getting in.</p>
