<p>I can't believe that I have most of a paper ready to be reviewed tonight in class. Yesterday morning, it seemed like I only had parts of each section. However, with a little work and lots of staring out the window, I have managed to write a paper that needs a bit of work. I know my first section is a bit jumpy and needs better transitions, but much of the rest just need to be checked for structure and to see if it actually says what I mean it to say.</p>
<p>Also, I have to make a presentation based on the paper for Monday night. I am not really looking forward to that but it's just 10 - 15 minutes, so it isn't terribly long.</p>
<p>Back to the paper...</p>
