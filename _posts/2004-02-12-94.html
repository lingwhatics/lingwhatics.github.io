<p>Ok so... for all the studying I did last night, I think I did quite well on my Neurolinguistics midterm. There were only a few 1 point questions that I wasn't sure of. Though, I still wonder if I put enough into some of my answers. Oh well... It is done now.</p>
<p>Now, studying for Sociolinguistics, which doesn't seem nearly as hard as the neuro midterm. Oh well... I will actually post later today.</p>

<br />State: Studying... No... Oh, bored that's the state I am thinking of.</p>
