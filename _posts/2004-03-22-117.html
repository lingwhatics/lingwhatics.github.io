<p>I don't really feel like updating... But I think that is in response to nobody else updating, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>I guess I will just write that I had a good weekend. Heather and I watched <em>Lost in Translation</em> on Friday night and I really like that movie. I managed to write part of two of my papers over the course of the weekend. And the rest of the time was spent watching basketball and laying around not doing much.</p>
