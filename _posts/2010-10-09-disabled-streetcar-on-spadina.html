<p>Arrived at Spadina and Queen to find a streetcar with a constantly dinging gong and a supervisor in the driver's seat trying to get it to stop making noise. It had begun to turn onto Queen. The front turning oh so slightly to the left. Thankfully it wasn't further otherwise the southbound service couldn't have gotten through.</p>
<p>Eventually, they got it all hooked up and ready for the next car to push the disabled one.<br />

<p>It was pushed through the intersection and continued down Queen Street. Presumably, it was pushed to Roncesvalles.<br />

<p>Then the supervisor did a good job of spreading out the service, which had bunched up a bit in the meanwhile.<br />
