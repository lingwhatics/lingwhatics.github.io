What am I up to these days? (2019-08-31)

Where: Montreal

What and Why: 

- Finishing my fourth month in Montreal and it has been a great summer to explore the city.
- Sadly, a week and a half after her 100th birthday my grandmother passed away. I went home for a long weekend to attend her funeral and visit with my family.
- I am still trying to get back on track for my goal of reading 30 books a year. I finished another book in June and have several books on the go that are progressing.

What's Next:

- Planning trips for the next year or so (Confirmed: Halifax [went in August], Florida; Possible: LA, Paris, Brazil)
- Practicing my French so that I pass my French proficiency test as part of my engineering license and so people will speak to me in French instead of switching to English.

Idea for this came from [Peter](https://ruk.ca/content/what-am-i-doing-now "What am I doing /now").
