<p>I got one finally. It was a bit cold out for the 7 or so hours before I got my ticket (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dalmond/337889354/">link</a>). My feet were really really cold but I think It was worth it. Wii Sports, which comes with it, is really fun. Heather and I  haven't tried the baseball game yet, but the others are fun, especially boxing and bowling.</p>
