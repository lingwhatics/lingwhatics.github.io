<p>Alright, today it was cold but none of my classes were cancelled, which was good. I even finished working on my endangered languages poster. I spent 2 hours in the SU iMac lab because I refuse to have Microsoft Word on my computer. And of course Adobe InDesign is still $235 for students. Oh well. </p>
<p>I found that I knew what was going on in Spanish because I did my homework assignment mostly without dictionary or book help. I succeeded in getting 93% on my first attempt. </p>
<p>During English class we watched a horribly, awfully acted rendition of a portion of <em>Things Fall Apart</em>. Though the most awful part was the theme song, my goodness. I really hope the person who wrote it didn't get paid.</p>
<p>Song: Sing, Sing, Sing from Swing Kids &amp; There Is by Boxcar Racer<br />
<br />State: Quite good.</p>
