<p>I am doing very well for working this semester. I have read something for classes every night this week. I even spent the last two hours making a list of all the Spanish vocabulary words from the book. (yea I am THAT cool.) I was reading about fMRI and PET as they relate to "mapping" language areas of the brain. I am about half done and it is long and only sort of interesting.</p>

<br />State: Pretty good considering how long I have been sitting here.</p>
