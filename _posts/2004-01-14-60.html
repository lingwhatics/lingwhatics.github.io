<p>You're a Crusader<br />
<br />By focusing on what others need, you learn the exact value and potential of each person in different situations. You instinctively know how motivated others are in supporting you. This helps you surround yourself with the right people.</p>
<p><img src="https://a820.g.akamai.net/f/820/822/1d/i.ivillage.com/dewey/redorange_small.gif" alt="Redorange" />The passionate you expresses unselfish devotion, monitors what is actually occurring, sets limits, and ensures each person's honor and respect. You give others the strength to be authentic to themselves.</p>
<p><img src="https://a820.g.akamai.net/f/820/822/1d/i.ivillage.com/dewey/brown_small.gif" alt="Brown" />The centered you is very grounding. You see what is authentic about each activity or relationship. When all is quiet within, you consider how you can feel more complete.</p>
<p><img src="https://a820.g.akamai.net/f/820/822/1d/i.ivillage.com/dewey/black_small.gif" alt="Black" />The emotional you makes rational, dispassionate decisions. Using only logic, you can see where others are excessive and inconsistent. You cut to the truth to focus on what needs to be done.</p>
