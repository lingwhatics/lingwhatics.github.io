<p>A post:<br />
<br />I am not really sure what I was thinking I would write when I came on here. I'm still not sure what I want to write. So I think I will just ramble about random things.</p>
<p>First of all, I hate the brain. It has too many parts, and they have random names. Ok so the names aren't really random. Lots of them make perfect sense, but I don't think in their logic so that is challenging for me to remember. (That's right things are hard for me too.)</p>
<p>Second, I'm not so fond of cold weather. I mean I will still walk to school for half an hour in it, but it doesn't make me happy. The prospect of it becoming â€“35 by Tuesday morning doesn't make me happy because I have to go to the school even though it is cold.</p>
<p>Third, umm... I can't think of anything else but I'm sure I will think of something... I know I'm also not fond of the fact that I never seem to get things done. Not projects, and school work I get that done. It is things that I think are important that I can't seem to accomplish. (and this music isn't helping) I'm sure somebody reading this will know what I am talking about, and I guess that is all that matters.</p>
<p>Fourth, after successfully not thinking about where I was going to live next year somebody has reminded me and I can't stop thinking about it. (thanks) Now I want to know where I am going to live and with whom.</p>
<p>Song: a few that aren't helping<br />
<br />State: I was good before, but now I'm not.</p>
