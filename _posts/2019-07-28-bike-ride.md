It was another free Bixi Sunday so I met up with someone and we biked along the Lachine Canal then down to Parc Angrignon. We walked through the park in a sun downpour that was quite refreshing in the hot afternoon. Next, we rode along the Lachine Aquaduct and down to Verdun for lunch before heading back toward home.

Total trip distance: 20.67 km
