Saturday morning ride to explore some new streets. After passing a spandex clad cyclist on the way up the hill on Atwater with my single-speed, I ended up following the Maisonneuve cycle track to Devil's Hill then went down to Ville Saint-Pierre before taking the series of detours that is the Lachine Canal path.

Total trip distance: 21.80 km

Moving time: 1h 15m
