<p>So Friday, Heather, Jamie and I went to see <a href="https://www.fidothemovie.com"><span style="font-style:italic;">Fido</span></a> and it was really funny. You should all go see it.</p>
<p>Apart from that we mostly just bummed around. I worked a bit and finished a lab. It was painfully boring at work. There were really no cars around. The lots were mostly empty and the meters were full and paid but there are not that many meters. Ah well.</p>
