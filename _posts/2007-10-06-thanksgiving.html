<p>Sitting on Thanksgiving weekend in my apartment and it is 22 (Humidex of 30) and it was warmer earlier, about 27. It is insanely nice out. It thunder stormed earlier in the afternoon but apart from that it is supposed to be a nice weekend. Sunday, we are off to Heather's parents for dinner and Monday we are going to my grandma's. It should be a nice weekend.</p>
