<p>So this week has been busy.</p>
<p>Monday night I went to see <span style="font-style:italic;">The Incredibles</span>. It was quite funny, definitely the best animated movie I had seen in a while.</p>
<p>Tuesday night I made it to the library to get the CD that I had on hold.</p>
<p>Wednesday night I went and had dinner at Melissa's then we went to the mall, played yahtzee, and watched <span style="font-style:italic;">Old School</span>. It was a better movie than I had anticipated.</p>
<p>I think that is all for now. I could go on about how much my Engg Econ prof dislikes all forms of government but that would be frivolous.</p>
<p>Song: <span style="font-style:italic;">none</span><br />Book: <span style="font-style:italic;">The Economist</span> (not really a book, but I'm reading it)</p>
