<p>By this time of the night I often feel like I haven't accomplished anything since I got home, but the truth of the matter is I have. I did Spanish, morpho and neuro, but that was all before dinner. It makes me feel like I wasted the night, which I kind of have.</p>
<p>I have decided I don't really like MSN and want to use another program... I suggest AIM because I can just us iChat to get onto it. Though I feel that this won't pick up because people don't like using new programs. And this would cause me to suggest ICQ, but people don't like that either. Oh well... I guess we will all just keep using MSN. Unless y'all want to surprise me and use one of those.</p>
