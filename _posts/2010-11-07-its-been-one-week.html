<p>Here is my progress thus far.</p>
<p><a title="Day 7 by dalmond, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalmond/5155762886/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1077/5155762886_b9311cc310.jpg" alt="Day 7" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>It is coming along and does not seem too bad as a moustache alone. Up to this point, people have donated $403 to the Prostate Cancer Canada through my growing efforts. You can donate too by going to my <a href="http://ca.movember.com/mospace/542470/">Movember space</a>. You can also look at all the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalmond/sets/72157625099948353/with/5155762886/">progress photos</a> on flickr.</p>
<p>Happy Movember to all and I hope your Mo is on the grow.</p>
