<p class="flickr-yourcomment">I'm done my courses now. Had my last exam this afternoon. The next couple days will be spent grading, but then I'm hoping it will be nice out. After marking, I'm starting my research.</p>
<p>This photo is from a trip I took to Humber's Lake Shore campus on Saturday with Heather and Cas. I didn't feel like sitting in an info session so I took photos outside. Quite a nice campus.</p>
