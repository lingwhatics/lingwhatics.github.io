<p>It has been a bit. The school term is just winding down. I have a couple of more days before the university is closed for the holidays. We've been busy in December. I was pet santa again this year. Another location had a tarantula brought in and I'm glad where I was didn't have anything so exotic.</p>
<p>I have recently rediscovered I had this song on my computer, and I quite enjoy the video.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to holidays, so I can get outside and rock my down sweater and take photos.</p>
<p>P.S.<br />
This video is also really cool.</p>
