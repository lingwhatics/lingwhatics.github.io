<p>I didn't have a plan for what I would do today, so I just wandered around downtown for several hours. On my way home the Japanese motorcade was still at Queen's Park so I stopped to see the Japanese Emperor and Empress come out. About an hour after I got there they came out.<br />

<p>After coming down and waving to the clapping crowd, they came to shake hands and talk to some of the people. Many in the crowd had been there for a few hours wanting to be right at the front in case he came to greet them in person, which he graciously did.<br />

<p>While this went on, the premier stood by and chatted up some of the crowd. "Thanks for recognizing me. I'm just here with the two movie stars." Friendly and amusing.<br />

<p>Afterwards, the motorcade headed off down University Avenue just as it had last night. Though last night it came from further up on Avenue Road past my apartment. I really wish I could capture all the red and blue lights filling the street a bit more readily with my camera; without resorting to a video mode.<br />
