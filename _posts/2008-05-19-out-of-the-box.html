<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	I got a new lens (Canon 50 mm f/1.4) the other day. It was new from Henry's on eBay. I saved less than I had hoped I would but it was still less than I found anywhere else online. So far I have liked it as much as the previous f/1.8 that I used. However, it focuses much faster in the dark.</p>
