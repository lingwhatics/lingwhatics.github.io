<p class="flickr-yourcomment">I fixed Heather's iPod mini, which seemed to have a dead hard drive. I replaced that drive with a 4GB CompactFlash card and now it works just fine. The only hard part of the process was getting the "guts" out of the metal because of a couple dents at the top.</p>
<p>Apart from the ipod magic, Heather and I had a calm Christmas weekend. We did some Boxing day browsing at the shops and picking up a few items. Saturday, we saw the Second City show Barack, to the Future. It was quite funny. Sunday, we had dinner with my Grandma and tried to stay out of the howling winds. So far it has been a good trip.</p>
