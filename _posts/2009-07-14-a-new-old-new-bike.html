<p>I got my sister to send me an old bike from the garage instead of buying a brand new one here. I'm making the bike into a singlespeed because it is basically flat around me to the south to most places that I don't go on the subway.</p>
<p>There are several things that I have to do to it before it will be ready including replacing the bent rear rim, moving the rear gears to the new rim, aligning the brakes, removing the gears and derailleurs, replacing the tire tubes (and maybe tires), and maybe getting a new seat post (this one might be a bit short for me). But I will post the photos when it is complete.</p>
