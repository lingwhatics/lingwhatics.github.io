This ride happened on February 20. I had to go pick up my bike from the bike room at our old place and the weather was not bad for a short ride. I pumped the tires and headed out on the ice and snow covered roads. I got a few blocks before I ended up at the canal where the snow was not packed enough for my skinny tires. It was a fun but short ride.

Total trip distance: 2.15 km

Moving time: 0h 17m
