<p class="flickr-yourcomment"> Took this while my project group was on a field trip to the Elbow Valley Experimental Wetland. It turned out better than I expected.</p>
<p>Today, I spent the day helping my dad move some renovation stuff into is cabin. It was pretty good. Though some of the things were quite heavy, especially the counter top.</p>
