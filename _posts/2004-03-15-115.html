<p>I haven't posted recently, but I dunno if what I have been doing is all that interesting to people other than me. And some of it, I don't even care about.</p>
<p>Let's see... Friday was great because it was the end of the week. Heather and I watched some movies and played a game where you roll little plastic pigs. Saturday I worked on assignments much of the day. Sunday I went to WestEd and met Rhoda, it was pretty good. I bought a jacket for like $8.50, but I'm not sure if I really like it or not yet. It doesn't really matter since it was cheap.</p>
<p>It's kind of annoying I have two papers due every week for the next three... But on the plus side I don't have any exams until finals, which are a month away.</p>
<p>I think things have been really great lately. I won't say I know what I am going to do when I'm done because I am not certain, but I have a good idea of what I want to do. I, also, am pretty sure I know where I am going to be this summer.</p>
<p>I don't really have anything more to write so I will wrap this up...</p>
