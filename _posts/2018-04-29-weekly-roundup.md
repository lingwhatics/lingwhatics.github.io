<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was out in public recently when an older woman walked up to me and started touching my face and talking to me as though she knew me. Immediately her husband stepped in, took her arm, turned her away &amp; handed me this card. It’s been months &amp; I’m still inspired by them. ❤️ <a href="https://t.co/5uiHvRPZ25">pic.twitter.com/5uiHvRPZ25</a></p>&mdash; NurseKelsey (@nursekelsey) <a href="https://twitter.com/nursekelsey/status/989613470399258625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 26, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
