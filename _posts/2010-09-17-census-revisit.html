<p>The following commentaries are from <em>Canadian Public Policy</em>, and represent thoughts about why the mandatory long form census is important to our country. Good decisions are based on good information, without a source of reliable and trustworthy statistics decision-takers are likely to shop around for information/statistics that suit their position. Having an independent, reliable and trustworthy statistics agency enables all parties to a decision to make their case in an equally informed context. Without symmetrical information, a market system becomes less efficient and probably less equitable.</p>

What Should Happen Now? </a> (possible mitigation of risk in voluntary long form. I like the idea of having a mandatory sign-off for people who choose not to fill out the voluntary questionnaire, thus forcing them to accept that they are not helping society as a whole through lack of time, lack of care or any other reason)</p>
<p>I would argue that if you are scared to tell the government how many bedrooms are in your house then you have a misunderstanding of what the government we have in Canada.</p>
<p>Also, I would venture that a minister such as former Minister of Industry Jim Prentice would not have allowed this to happen. I have faith that there are some in the current government who can and would stand up against the arguments advanced against the census.</p>
