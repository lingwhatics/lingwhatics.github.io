<p>Good Evening to all.  So classes are coming along I can't believe that I am almost done my 3rd week.  Unfortunately I haven't really kept up with reading in all my classes.  </p>
<p>I have read practically all my readings for one of my classes. (History) I think I did those because I have a reaction paper due on Monday in that class.  That's cool I will get it done. I finished my French today and it isn't due until tomorrow.  </p>
<p>My life is crazy.  Not because it is hectic but because it seems like time just disappears.  I accomplish things but never as much as I want.</p>
<p>Anyway I guess I will end this now because I don't want to tell y'all anymore.</p>
<p>Mood: Torn (like Rip Torn he's funny)<br />
<br />State: My eye is going to float out of the socket<br />
<br />Song: Are You Happy Now? - Michelle Branch</p>
