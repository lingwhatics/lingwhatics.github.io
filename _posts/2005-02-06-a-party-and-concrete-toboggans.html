<p>Barely anything has been accomplished today, but it doesn't matter. Things can be accomplished whenever there is time, and time will come available.</p>
<p>Last night, I went to Linds's house warming party, and it was quite fun. There was foosball, an arcade game, talking and some drinking. The party was much more fun than I had anticipated. I ended up knowing a few people connected to her roommates.</p>
<p>During the afternoon yesterday, I went to the <a href="https://www.gnctr2005.ca/">GNCTR</a> at COP, and that was fun too. I got a bunch of pictures of the toboggans coming down the hill, but I haven't put them on my computer yet. Although it was cold out, I didn't feel cold until I got on the bus to head home. While on the bus, I finished my book, and have yet to start another one.</p>
<p>It was a fun weekend with the party last night and the movie on Friday night.</p>
