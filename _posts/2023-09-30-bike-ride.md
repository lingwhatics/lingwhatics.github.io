Our first ride in a few weeks after being away on vacation. We went along the aquaduct canal to Lachine and then continued along the water to a playground in Dorval. We briefly considered continuing to Pointe-Claire village but the train schedule didn't work for a faster return to make nap time work. Instead, we continued back along the Lachine canal.

Total trip distance: 37.61 km

Moving time: 2h22
