<p>I spent the day at school today (8-7.30). I got quite a bit done but it was a long day. Thankfully, I got a ride there and home so I didn't spend all kinds of time waiting for the bus.</p>
<p>Over the day, I did have the TFC game and the Leafs on streaming from CBC, who still have a crappy streaming engine by the way. And I spent the rest of the evening chatting on the Internet and fending off baby cousins from tearing apart my room and stealing my video game controllers. Oddly, they liked the joystick on the game cube controller more than the blinking lights of the Wiimote.</p>
