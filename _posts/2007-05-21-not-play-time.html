<p>this is Creamsicle Heather's kitten. She is so cute and crazy.</p>
<p>Saturday night, Heather and I went across Eglinton to the theatre to see <span style="font-style:italic;">Hot Fuzz</span>. It was a great British movie. It had many of the characters from <span style="font-style:italic;">Shaun of the Dead</span>. If it is on, you should go see it.</p>
