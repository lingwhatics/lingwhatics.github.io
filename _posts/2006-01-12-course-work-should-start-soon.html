<p>I'm currently sitting in the ICT building on the second floor and I'm waiting for a lab to start. I actually have no clue what is going to happen in the lab as I didn't get a course outline for this class because 99% of the class is the same as last semester. So, I have random things in my bag which make it heavy and I bet I won't use any of them. Oh well, better to have the things than not have them if I need them.</p>
<p>I dropped my Technical Communications class this morning to because I don't think I would be able to stand that prof all semester. His way of sitting at the front of the class and adding things to everything anybody says is irritating. Though I will have to take it eventually, I will avoid that prof as much as I can. I still have five classes, but I am told that the first year one I am taking will be the biggest waste of my life ever. Even more than ENGG 215 in my first year, which seems odd because this one has the same prof.</p>
<p>Like the title suggests, I should start doing course work soon, but of course that never seems to happen until assignments are almost due. Maybe I will change that this semester and start doing readings and problems sooner. However, I know I have planned to do this for 8 semesters and 3 spring/summer sessions and it has yet to occur, so I'm not holding on to hope.</p>
<p>My lab starts in 10 minutes so I think I will gather with the other people at the locked door. I don't know what is going to happen in the lab. I really thought they had to give out course outlines in all classes and it was my option to pick it up not their option to offer me one.</p>
<p>Oh well, more later, perhaps after work.</p>
