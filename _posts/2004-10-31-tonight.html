<p>Tonight, was kind of a crappy night. There was a party on my floor and I could have gone to a keg party. I stayed on my floor and sat in the party for a while chatting with people. However, I found that mostly there wasn't anybody who really wanted to chat with me. So, eventually I came and hung out in my room for a while, and that didn't change anything because when I went back to the party there weren't really any more people there.</p>
<p>Even though we had a really good time today decorating the lounge for the party, I barely had any fun at the party. Everybody who was there seemed to have somebody that they were talking to and I was just the odd person out.<br /></p>
