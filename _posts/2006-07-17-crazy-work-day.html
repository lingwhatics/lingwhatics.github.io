<p>Last night, I was working and lots of odd stuff happened. The strangest thing I found was a van full of dogs. I called security and they got the police and city involved. You can see the short news story about it <a href="http://calgary.ctv.ca/servlet/RTGAMArticleHTMLTemplate/B/20060716/dogs?brand=generic&amp;hub=&amp;tf=CFCNPlus/generic/hubs/frontpage.html&amp;cf=CFCNPlus/generic/hubs/frontpage.cfg&amp;slug=dogs&amp;date=20060716&amp;archive=CFCNPlus&amp;ad_page_name=&amp;nav=home&amp;subnav=fullstory&amp;site_cfcn=http://calgary.ctv.ca">here</a> from CTV.</p>
<p>Also last night, Heather and I went for a walk down along the river with Rhoda. It was enjoyable. This morning Heather and I went to Nellie's for brunch. It was very good.</p>
<p>I don't have much to write at the moment. I think that will be all.</p>
