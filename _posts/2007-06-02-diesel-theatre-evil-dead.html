<p>Last night, we saw Evil Dead The Musical. The show was really funny. I went with Heather and her brother. The play house (Diesel) was really nice the set up was neat. There were "tables" with four people each. I call them "tables" because they were small and only one person could put their legs under. However, we were in the back row and the view was really good.</p>
<p>They served drinks and food. Both were very good. All in all it was a really good theatre experience and I would go see another show there for sure.</p>
