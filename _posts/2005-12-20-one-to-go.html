<p>Only one more to go, then I can be done like everybody else. My exam today was fine. It seemed short. I think my first little essay was a bit short but my second one was long and elaborate so hopefully it will even out. My group project was given an A for a mark so hopefully that is actually translated into a good percentage of the 30% it was worth. I think my prof is one of those who believes that A+ is different than A, which it really isn't at UofC.</p>
