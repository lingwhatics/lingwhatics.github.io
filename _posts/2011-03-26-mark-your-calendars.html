<p>It's official. May 2nd, 2011 is election day.</p>
<p>After slogging through poorly thought out election advertising and stump speeches, we will get to choose between whatever programs the parties pretend they will implement.</p>
<p>It is after the election that the real hard work begins of holding your new MP to account. Tracking their voting record and what they say in the House of Commons will keep you informed. One tool that makes this easy is <a title="OpenParliament.ca" href="http://openparliament.ca/" target="_blank">OpenParliament.ca</a>. Write your MP and tell them what you think about how they're doing.</p>
<p><em>Aside: In a twist of amusing positioning, Stephen Harper just accused Michael Ignatieff of having a hidden agenda.</em></p>
