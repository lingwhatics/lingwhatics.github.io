<p>I have finally bought a new camera: Canon Power Shot G11. It took me a while. I've been looking at this one pretty much since it was released last September, but I'm not that good at actually buying things. I almost got a LX3 instead but they only had a show model left and they are not carrying it anymore (it is a few years old).</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope it does everything I try to make it do.</p>
