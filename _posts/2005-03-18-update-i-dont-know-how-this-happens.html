<p>It's St. Patrick's Day. That's all I've got... not really, but it seems that way.</p>
<p>I had the joy of going to the dentist today which was pretty good. I only had a cleaning today. I don't have my check up until September, which is kind of nice. I had hardly anything to do at work today so I did particle size tests all day, well the time I was there, only 5.5 hours. I got some Engg Econ questions done while I was waiting for my class to start and ate an okay donair from Pita-on-the-Run. (I think that is what it is called.) Anyway, it wasn't as packed as the ones I got last semester from Marco's Famous, but it was ok. I hear they opened a new Falafel King in Kensington, so one day soon I will have to go there, and if this is untrue then I can get a Vietnamese sub from the place beside Chicken-on-the-Way.</p>
<p>I didn't get my job at the bookstore but was told to apply for some things that were opening up, which was a good sign. I also got another call today for something so I will set up an interview for that tomorrow, hopefully. I'm sort of bored this week and really quite tired. It doesn't help that I go to bed at almost midnight.</p>
<p>I put up shelves when I got home on Sunday and they are nice and then I put up a shelf under my window last night and found a place for another piece of furniture in my room so now I have all the furniture organised. All I have to do is find an organised way to have all my things.</p>
<p>Umm... I don't know what else. I finished reading <span style="font-style:italic;">The Chosen</span> by Chaim Potok yesterday, I really liked it. Apparently it has a sequel so I will try to find that at the library. Did you know that the Calgary Public Library is the second most active library in Canada, only second to GTA though they lump all the libraries together there, so it probably isn't actually that far behind the Toronto Public Library on it's own. I love the library, it's great. I don't have to spend all my money on books and also I don't feel annoyed when I don't like a book since I can just return it and not have to explain to some salesperson that the book stinks and I can't keep reading it. Also, I don't have to pay for magazines, since they are expensive and only current for a short period of time, such is a magazine.</p>
<p>Hopefully I will get to watch some basketball this weekend, and I will get studying done for my midterm on Monday. I will do fine on it, but I want to do great, since then I will maybe get a better average for entering second year Engg in the fall. What if I want to do something that isn't Civil... like Mechanical... I dunno if I really do but I never even considered it before. I should really do proper research and then make my decision, though I think it will turn out with Civil as #1 choice. Oh right I should ask if I can change my second program choice. For some reason I couldn't choose Ling as my second choice because it was part of my first choice but I could choose a different kind of Engineering, ah well.</p>
<p>I think that is enough for now.</p>
