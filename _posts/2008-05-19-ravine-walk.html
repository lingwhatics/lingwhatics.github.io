Today, Heather and I went on a walk in one of the many ravines that snake through the city. Most people in the city probably don't think about going to these. They are very nice walks. Today's was 9.3 km.</p>
<p>Where we walked today runs from just north of St Clair and east of Yonge to a bit north of Bloor and Mount Pleasant. (Well a path continues beyond Mount Pleasant, which we walked today all the way to the Don Valley.) The edges of the stream are built up with erosion controls of meshed rocks or old sidewalk chunks.</p>
<p>The ravine is sheltered which made it much warmer than elsewhere today. It was windy on the way to the ravine.</p>
