<p>Very little reading online this week as I have been a bit busy moving and starting a new job. Regularly scheduled post should return next weekend when I will once again have Internet in my apartment.</p>
<p>The job is good thus far and the office is quite friendly. My new car is zoom zoom-y and has been fine for moving most things so far. One more full load and the. Some errands to finish the partial move to Ottawa.</p>
