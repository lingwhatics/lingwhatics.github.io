<p>Hey all... I'm tired, I worked from 5pm  (Fri) until 1am (Sat) and tomorrow night I will probably work about the same. Which is annoying because I miss the last bus and have to walk home, which takes another 32 minutes. Anyway I start my University job on Monday morning.</p>
<p>WARNING [begin Shameless plug]... <a href="http://www.juliosbarrio.com/">Julio's Barrio</a> has opened in Kensington and it's good eats. [end Shameless plug] I had the Mexican Caesar salad tonight and it wasn't nachos but it was good anyway. I also had something else a Quesedilla what was made wrong so the line cook gave it to the dishwashers.</p>
