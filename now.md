What am I up to these days? (2019-03-30)

Where: Toronto (but off to Montreal in a month)

What and Why: 

- Trying to get back on track for my goal of reading 30 books a year. I have not finished a book since the start of January, but I do have several on the go.
- I have been helping out with the office knitting club. Everyone is knitting squares that will be assembled into a quilt to be raffled off at our annual charity night.
- Continuing to learn R to apply it to data analysis and graphic creation at work and home. 
- I gave a talk at work about visualization to get everyone thinking about improving the level of visual communication. I included information about colour visual deficiencies that was well received by several people who commented that they alway have trouble because most people don't think about their needs.
- Travelled to Montreal for a weekend with some of my family.
- Keeping up my Portuguese learning because it is interesting and maybe one day it will be useful too.

What's Next:

- Moving to Montreal in May to take up a similar role at the same company
- Planning trips for the next year or so (Montreal, Brazil, LA, to be determined)
- Trip home for my grandmother's 100th birthday
- Practicing my French so I will be able to keep up once I get to Montreal

Idea for this came from [Peter](https://ruk.ca/content/what-am-i-doing-now "What am I doing /now").
