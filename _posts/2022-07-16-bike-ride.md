Just a quick trip out to Verdun to drop Doris off for some volunteering, then back to Pointe-Saint-Charles while the baby napped on the seat before we went to Costco. The first attempt and success of a Costco run on the Yuba. After filling the fridge with the spoils from Costco, we went back to Verdun to meet Doris, have lunch and return home.

Total trip distance: 27.96 km

Moving time: 2h 17m
