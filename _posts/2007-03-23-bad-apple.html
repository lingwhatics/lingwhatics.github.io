<p>My computer has been in the shop waiting for a second new logic board for a two weeks. It has been in the shop for three weeks. I'm not sure how that is acceptable <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">AppleCare</span>. They say it will be ready Monday but yesterday they told me it would be ready today and the person just told me that they didn't order the second new part (the first "new" logic board was faulty) until I called to see where my computer was.</p>
