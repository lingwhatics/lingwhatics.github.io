<p>After a long weekend it is often hard to get any work done. Fortunately, not this time. This morning I got up and went to the university. I added a few functions to my model and didn't spend much time trying to motivate myself to do it. It was nice.</p>
<p>This weekend was long for most, but I really only had two days off. They were however together. My weekends usually involve working right in the middle of them at parking. I did have to work on Saturday night for the football game but that was pretty nice. It was busy since Calgary was playing Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>Sunday morning, Heather, Rhoda, Jasmine, Leanne and I headed off to Big Hill Springs provincial park for a picnic and hike/walk. It was quite a lot of fun. It was busier than I have ever seen it. The parking lot, which is fairly small, was full of cars, mostly, and a few trucks/campers. I took a bunch of pictures and posted about 2/5 of them. (<a href="https://flickr.com/photos/dalmond/sets/72157594228396713/">Flickr link</a>) Later, we watched random TV at Jasmine's.</p>
<p>Monday was a sleep in day. It was quite nice to get up just before noon. Most of the day was spent looking at photos and watching TV. It was a good time.</p>
<p>I think that is all for now.</p>
