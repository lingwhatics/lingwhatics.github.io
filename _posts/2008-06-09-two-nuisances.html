<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	Shopping carts end up all over the place. I am actually surprised that there aren't any by-laws that regulate keeping these at their store. As for the billboards there are by-laws that aren't being enforced properly. (This one is likely legal because it is on railway lands.)</p>
