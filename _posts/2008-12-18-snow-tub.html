<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	It was still cold out today. But after taking a few photos, I cleared the top of the driveway of ice. It was really thick and now my thumb hurts from the ice chipper, but I think it was worth it. I like being able to use the driveway without sliding down it. Hopefully when it eventually gets warm it won't be so slippery without all the meltable stuff at the top.</p>
<p>Apart from that I really didn't do anything productive today. I have to get up and work tomorrow, but that will be nice. I won't feel like I wasted the day doing nothing.</p>
<p>Only a week until I'm in Toronto. With any luck there won't be piles of snow as large as here. There would really have to be a couple huge dumps for that to happen and I don't think that the residents would accept that so I'm glad it isn't going to happen.</p>
