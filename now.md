What am I up to these days? (2020-06-14)

Where: Montreal

What and Why: 

- I mean working from home and walking in the park every day is fine, but I'd really like to go to an office and work.
- At the beginning of the pandemic I was reading quite a bit but that sort of faded in favour of TV and it feeling like the work days all became one never ending period in the "home office". Now that the warm weather is here, I have started reading again and sitting out in the sun so I will probably catch up to my goal of 2 books per month.
- I totally gave up on learning python because, while it is the language of choice in the office, I just don't find it as intuitive as R.
- Montreal winter was nice. I even got out cross-country skiing (though I hated most of it).
- Before the pandemic hit, my girlfriend and I spent a nice long weekend in Boston where the weather happened to be beautiful and the food was quite good. 
- I did not expect to move after only a year at my place but, when we all started working from home, I joined another household and never looked back.

What's Next:

- Learning to paint (I received watercolours and a large how to paint book for Christmas).
- All the trips were cancelled so maybe planning fantasy trips for the next year or so (Confirmed: Halifax [May - Nope], Cape Breton [June - Nope]; Possible: LA, Paris).
- Getting back to practicing my French and taking a French course with my office. I have not spent as much time speaking French while working from home. The amount I listen to has not really changed thought (podcasts and random TV).

Idea for this came from [Peter](https://ruk.ca/content/what-am-i-doing-now "What am I doing /now").
