<p>See they all look good.</p>
<p>Today, Heather and I went up Yonge to get some gifts and then each went somewhere else to get more gifts. It was quite busy downtown. But after 3 stores I found the size I was looking for.</p>
<p>Off to get bottle refunds and another gift (it isn't one of mine, I'm done now.) Maybe some more photos later.</p>
