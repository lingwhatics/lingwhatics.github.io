<p class="flickr-yourcomment"> On my sidebar here, my flickr thing says I have one Explore picture. This is the one. It seems odd to me that this rather normal photo of the Butterdome would end up there. (Explore is where cool pictures go when they have specific cirteria met. One being "Interestingness". I'm not sure how that is calculated but this photo had it at the time.)</p>
<p>Also, this can continue along my Edmonton is sort of cool idea.</p>
