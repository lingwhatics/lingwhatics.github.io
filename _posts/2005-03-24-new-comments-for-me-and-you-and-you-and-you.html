<p>I have decided that nobody ever uses my trackback so I might as well just use Blogger comments. So this is a test mostly to see if the code I put in disables new HaloScan comments and enables the Blogger ones.</p>
<p>I had a pretty good day at work. I put some tables together and cleaned the grinding room.</p>
<p>That's all for now.</p>
