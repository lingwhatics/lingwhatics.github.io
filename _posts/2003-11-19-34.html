<p>Good evening to you all.  I don't really have much to write other than I'm getting annoyed with the university because I can't get into the class ection that I want.  I want to take Spanish but I also need to take a class for my major and currently I'm registered in Spanish at the same time as i need to put the other class. And it is "too early" for an advisor to let me into the class, which is dumb because won't they feel bad when the other class is too full for me to register in when I get into the proper spanish lecture.</p>
<p>And I finally got GIMP to work in X11 so I made a first draft of the flag.  Though I may have seen this flag somewhere before.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ualberta.ca/~mikalson/flag.jpg" height="200" /></p>
<p>So there it is.</p>
<p>What if I'm sad? I don't actually think I really am but what if?</p>
