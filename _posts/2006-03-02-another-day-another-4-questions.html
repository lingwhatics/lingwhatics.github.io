<p>Another midterm passed today and I think it went quite well. What is with midterms having 4 long answer questions?</p>
<p>I have done a total of 12 practice questions for the class and I did them all today. For some reason it isn't that high on my priority list. I even worked on a lab report last night instead of studying. Oh well.</p>
<p>I got 82.5% on my ENME 341 midterm well that's what it says on Blackboard but I will get it back tomorrow to morning and see if it is actually recorded correctly. It seems that I'm good at fluid mechanics and thermodynamics because I found the exams relatively easy despite not doing much in the way of practice beforehand.</p>
