<p><a title="Moonset by dalmond, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dalmond/3268029249/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3344/3268029249_5e2d2b399e.jpg" alt="Moonset" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>This is what I have seen for the last few days on the way to work. Moon shrouded by clouds and not quite the lens to capture what I want. I guess I will switch to the 50mm from the 28mm and see what happens tomorrow.</p>
<p>It is almost reading week. I'm not sure how much reading I will get done. I know I will go to Toronto again and have fun there.</p>
<p>I'm still waiting on a reference letter for the two masters programs I applied to, but I'm sure it will arrive before the end of the month when UofT wants it in. After spending the other night making a resume, I found a job to use that resume to apply to. Of course, I have no idea which I will choose if I managed to get that job and the NSERC scholarship for school. A decision that I can make if it arises.</p>
<p>In other news, I'm on twitter now. There's a link to the right under my photos. I figured short messages was most of what I had been using facebook for so why not try it out.</p>
