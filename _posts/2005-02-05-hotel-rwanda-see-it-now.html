<p>I saw a great moving tonight, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395169/"><span style="font-style:italic;">Hotel Rwanda</span></a>. It was well made and it seemed historically accurate. The only thing is that I think the Canadian Colonel in the movie was supposed to be the General Romeo Dallaire. Other than that. Anyway, the story is very good, since it is mostly true, and it is a thinking movie like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280491/"><span style="font-style:italic;">Bloody Sunday</span></a>. Did I mention that the movie was amazing.</p>
<p>That's all for now. I think I will go the Great Northern Concrete Toboggan Races tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>Song: War on Drugs - Barenaked Ladies<br />
<br />Book: I have 5 pages left of the one I have been reading. I almost finished in the week on the bus.</p>
<p>What are you still reading for? Go see the movie...<br /></p>
