<p>I did Line Set again today, but I wasn't really that surprised. I got there, got on my kitchen clothes, and was told that I would be doing it again today. The prep kitchen was quite busy today too and there weren't really enough people to do the work that was to be done. After the lunch rush finished, I went back into the prep kitchen and made 50 some fajita portions.</p>
<p>I don't really know what I will do tonight because I don't really feel like going out, but at the same time I don't want to stay in and do nothing. I'm sure that I will find something to do. Also, it has been an odd day, every time that I have gone on Messenger with the exception of one there has been nobody online... no one you might say. Oh well.</p>
