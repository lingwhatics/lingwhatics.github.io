<p>Well, studying isn't very fun. Which is really a problem.  I think it should be banned. But that's neither here nor there.  </p>
<p>I don't know what to write on here. I had a good idea before I logged on but it evaporated (or whatever ideas do).  I guess I could just go back to studying or go to bed.  I didn't go to bed last night until 12.30 and then I read until almost 3.  It was just great. Then I didn't get up until 10.30 and read until 11.30.  So not much got done this morning.  Other than a shower and breakfast.</p>
<p>Oddly enough I have had a pretty good time since Wednesday afternoon when classes ended.</p>
<p>I think sleep is called for now. </p>
