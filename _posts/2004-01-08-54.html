<p>I have been tinkering with CSS this afternoon and you probably won't notice any difference here but eventually I will post what I have done.</p>
<p>Since I haven't done anything all afternoon maybe I should read something for my courses. I don't really think I will though.  And in other news I am still missing my history grade.</p>
<p>Song: You Get Me and 'Til I Get Over You both by Michelle Branch<br />
<br />State: sorta you know. I dunno really I will tell you later.</p>
