This is an experiment to see if I will actually start working on all the little projects that I have been thinking about.

A few ideas I have had:

- writing the functions of Environment Canada's CFA (Consolidated Frequency Analysis) in R
- making a proof of concept reproducibly generated presentation for my work colleagues
- setting up a database for my cycling GPS traces so I can make maps and analyze them more easily

Of course, this is all a test that might fail if I just continue drawing lines on OpenStreetMaps in random areas and for [HotOSM](https://hotosm.org). I imagine I can get some of the above going as I have only been planning to do the first item since late 2012.
