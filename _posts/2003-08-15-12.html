<p>Only days from now I will be hanging out with Rhoda and Meghan and i am really lookign forward to that, but at the same time I will lose something to complain about.  It was a good thing in my mind all summer that if i ever ran out of complaints i could use it. (Like i would ever run out of complaints.)  I hardly ever used it but the thought was there.</p>
<p>12 days until I go to Edmonton and get ready to go to a new school again. At least this time it isn't Engineering.  </p>
<p>Weather:  Hot (-ish), hazy (smoky)<br />
