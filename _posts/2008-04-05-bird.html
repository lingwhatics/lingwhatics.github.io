<p class="flickr-yourcomment"> The rest of the day, we walked around town. This bird was on Queen West up on a storefront piece d'art.</p>
<p>After visiting some fabric stores along Queen West, and passing and greeting my uncle at Ossington, we had lunch at <a href="http://www.cinnamongirls.ca/">Cinnamon Girls</a>. The food was really tasty. We were happy not to have stopped earlier. Though, we had thought they were only open Monday to Friday, but were pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>Another stop at a fabric store and a computer store, led us to take the subway to take a ride on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarborough_RT_%28TTC%29">the Scarborough RT</a>. Let me tell you it is nothing to bother going to ride. The trains are small and noisy. I have read people call it a "toy train" and now I know why. Following this, we took a bus ride along Eglinton, which may have been faster than taking a combination of subways to the same place.</p>
<p>It was a long day.</p>
