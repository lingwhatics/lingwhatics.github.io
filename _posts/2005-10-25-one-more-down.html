<p>Just got home from my probability midterm and I don't feel that bad about it. Though as most people said after it they probably failed. I don't think I failed after I had gone through the whole test I had 7 questions that I hadn't answered. I went back and think I answered 4 of them right and 1 I guessed, 1 I think I put the wrong answer and the other I have no clue.</p>
<p>I have a short paper to write for Thursday morning, a pre-lab for Friday and an assignment for Monday. That is before I move on to a midterm next Tuesday and Wednesday nights and the Friday as well.</p>
<p>This weekend wasn't all that eventful in terms of things I don't usually do, but I did go for dinner on Friday night with Heather to Madison's which was almost as good as the last time we went. Saturday night I worked and Sunday afternoon I studied and did some Math. Heather and I watched <span style="font-style:italic;">Sideways</span> at some point, I think Friday night.</p>
<p>I finished reading <span style="font-style:italic;">The Efficient Society</span> and it was quite enjoyable. Yesterday and today I read Jon Stewart's <span style="font-style:italic;">Naked Pictures of Famous People</span>, and it has been quite funny. Though, I'm quite sure that it is a book that I'm glad I got from the library because I see no point in owning it.</p>
<p>This has been a pointless post.</p>
<p>Song: Lovers in a Dangerous Time - Barenaked Ladies</p>
