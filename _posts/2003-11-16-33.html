<p>I am trying to work on a couple projects, and things aren't going how i want them to be.  I am not having much trouble with getting information.  I am having difficulty in working on them.  I don't know why I can't seem to get going. </p>
<p>And there is nobody here that is able to do stuff with me.  Everybody I talked to tonight was busy. Kind of anonying but I should be working anyway.</p>
<p>Nothing much that is new here. Because well I don't seem to do what i set out to do.</p>
