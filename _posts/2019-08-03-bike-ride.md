I was up early again today, for no reason, so I jumped out of bed and went riding. First around Nun's Island where I sat at the southern point of the island. Then across the ice control structure for the Champlain Bridge and along the strip of land between the Saint Lawrence River and the Seaway, and quickly through Parc Jean-Drapeau before heading home.

Total trip distance: 30.23 km

Moving time: 1h 33m
