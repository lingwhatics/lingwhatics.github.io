<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	After we left a party in the Beaches Saturday night, Queen street wasn't so busy so I could stand in the middle and get this shot. One of many I took but this one turned out better than others.</p>
<p>I really like the look of the streetcar tracks outside the centre line.</p>
