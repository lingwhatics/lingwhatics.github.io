<p class="flickr-yourcomment"> Things have taken a turn for the cold. Though, I am not surprised, but a little disappointed. I broke out my neck tube today and will probably wear both halves of my jacket tomorrow.</p>
<p>The past week, it seems like I have accomplished very little. I have done a couple assignments and written/researched some of my group project fall paper. In fact, I just had a breakthrough in what I was writing, so I took a break. I still have 3 or 4 assignments to go in the next 2 weeks and one exam, but I think i know what I'm doing in many of my classes.</p>
<p>I don't really know what else. I should get back to that important writing.</p>
