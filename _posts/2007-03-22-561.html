<p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/03/21/harper-attack.html">Stephen Harper shows his true colours</a>... Since when does disagreeing with one point of view automatically mean you support the "opposite" view? (As if the world is black and white).</p>
<p>Somebody had a good point the other day about "losing" those Taliban prisoners. They said that they could quite possibly be out there planting bombs (IEDs in politico-speak) or attacking Canadian troops in another way and if we still kept track of them then we would know they weren't doing that.</p>
<p>Be wary of politicians who hide their true stripes. At least, we all know that Harper is a zebra and not the horse he claims to be. On that note you should go stand up behind your troops and call for the defence minister to resign because ignorance is no excuse for a minister.</p>
