<p>I have never been to 1055, which is what the restaurant is called if I remember correctly, but I do like Steam Whistle. It is good beer and they have nice green bottles. Since it is local the bottles actually get reused. Their boxes are nice too. No glue, just flaps that can be resealed and... gasp... reused. Those nutty roundhouse dwellers.</p>
