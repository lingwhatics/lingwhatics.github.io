<p>Finally somebody who understands what Kenney said in Calgary. He didn't say all immigrants had to speak English/French. He, in fact, said that if you want to be a citizen of our country with its two official languages then you had to be able to operated in at least one of them. This is a minimum that should be acceptable to a reasonable person. Why should anybody expect to be a citizen of a country in which they cannot interact with the government in its official language(s).</p>
