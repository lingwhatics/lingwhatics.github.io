It has been a busy month so far. I spent the first week of May in Toronto for work at a PMP boot camp, but this let me enjoy some of my favourite restaurants that still exist (Tofu Village, Wvrst, Salad King) and spend the weekend with friends. The next week and a bit I spent all my evenings studying for the PMP exam, which I passed on Thursday this week. I am so happy it is done and I can go back to having too much to do on all my projects.

Last Saturday, I celebrated being at Arup for 10 years.
