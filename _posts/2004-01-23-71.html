<p>Alright, I don't know what to write today. I haven't done much tonight and there was hardly any new TV on. I suppose I might just go to bed. </p>
<p>You know what is annoying? That commercial telling people to complain to the CRTC about Telus. They sing off tune.</p>
<p>Song: Carrying the Banner<br />
<br />State: kinda annoyed, no particular reason</p>
