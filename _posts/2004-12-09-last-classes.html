<p>I have officially finished my classes at the <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/">U of A</a> and it's quite nice. My classes yesterday weren't that bad actually, and my last class was only 15 minutes long. Last night a bunch of people decided they were going to drink but I didn't really feel like walking to the liquor store in the -16 weather, so I didn't drink. I watched TV with Heather for a while. We watched <span style="font-style:italic;">America's Next Top Model</span>, which is really one of the dumbest shows that I watch on TV. I was going to say dumbest on TV but that's a really strong assertion knowing the kind of dirt and grime that gets played these days.</p>
<p>I have four exams to write next week, Monday, Wednesday and two on Thursday, Though they are in the wrong order. The one I have to study for least is first and the ones I want to study for more are on the same day. Oh my one on Wednesday is in the afternoon (we can only have exams at 9 AM or 2 Pm here) so it's like I have 3 exams in a row. I'm sure it will be fine.</p>
<p>I'll sign off for now, but no promises that I won't be back later this afternoon to write  more and more and more.</p>
