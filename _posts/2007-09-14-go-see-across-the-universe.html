<p>Just got back from <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/across+the+universe"><span style="font-style:italic;">Across the Universe</span></a> (<a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/acrosstheuniverse/medium.html">trailer</a>). It was quite a good movie. You should go see it. Though it might not be playing in your city yet. It has much singing of Beatles songs and some story going on too. Though some may be put off by the 2 hour running time, don't be; the movie is well worth the time but don't go to a cheap theatre that skimps on the seat comfy-<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">ness</span>.</p>
