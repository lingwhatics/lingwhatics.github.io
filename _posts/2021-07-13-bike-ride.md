It was a daycare integration morning for the baby so I had a few hours free to get on my bike. Since I was already downtown, I decided to take on Chemin Olmstead up to the Mont-Royal lookout. It was a slow ride but certainly possible on a single-speed. It is great to see the water fountains on everywhere (a rare occurence in my time in Toronto).

Total trip distance: 18.29 km

Moving time: 1h 23m
