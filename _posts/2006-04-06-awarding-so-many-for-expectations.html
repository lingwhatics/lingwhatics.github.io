<p>Today, I almost have a summer position. I was granted an <a href="https://www.nserc.gc.ca/index.htm">NSERC</a> undergraduate student research award. I'm not sure how this happened but the supervisor I will be working for is working on transportation engineering, which is what I am interested in pursuing. It will be a good opportunity to get some hands on research experience and a closer look at transportation.</p>
<p>That's all I have to say for today because well it is late and I missed my Tuesday morning lectures because I slept in until almost noon and should probably go to tomorrow's lectures. I also have to go accept that award.</p>
