<p>Another week is gone, and I don't know where it went. It actually boggles my mind to think that it is Friday. It seem like Monday was yesterday and I was stating my book. Alas it is not.  Mind you it wasn't a bad week, apart from me being tired for much of it.</p>
<p>A new paragraph because a new idea unfortunately the idea has just fled out of my head. I did read a funny line in a story I read this week. It is from <em>The Nakedman</em>.  It is something like "if that sequin dress had slits it could be called a strange sequins of vents." Yea ok it might not be funny so much as cheesy but I like it.</p>
