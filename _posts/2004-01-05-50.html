<p>So here I am. Done my first day of the new semester and I don't know I hope I can still take my semantics class because that would be good. Otherwise I have to figure out what I should take.  And I am really tired of working with the silly registration system.  (I'm not really complaining because I know that UofC has a much more annoying system, in some respects. e.g. Operating hours, and being a pain to login.  UofA has a new system where the whole page refreshes everytime, even though it appears to me that it is indeed frames, but I'm not judging their programming abilities.)</p>
<p>So classes were good and now I am trying to remember things from Spanish because I have to write ten sentences describing me for class tomorrow.  I am half done so I'm more taking a break than procrastinating. </p>
<p>People are odd and seem to ignore things that are quite important while they dwell on the most insignificant things, but that is not what I want to talk about because then it might be an essay of sorts.  That just seems like a bad use of my time.</p>
