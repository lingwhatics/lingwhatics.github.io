<p class="flickr-yourcomment">The new local map in Summerhill doesn't have the right station location, which is a bit worrisome. I would hope that if they did this internally that all involved were new and didn't know better; and if it were done externally that somebody new at the TTC gave out bad info. However, both those options would be letting the TTC off too easily. It isn't a new station and has only been open in that location since 1954.</p>
