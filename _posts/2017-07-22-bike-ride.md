Today's I took a longer ride (35.5 km) out of my normal riding grid. I stopped for lunch at Mi Pueblo Lindo at the most northerly point of the path. The ride up Weston Road was alright except getting past the ramps to the 401. Coming back down Jane was alright, but the catch basin covers could use some work to bring them back up to the road surface.
