<p>This weekend Heather and I went to Edmonton and it was fun, of course.</p>
<p>I will write about it tomorrow. I think I will just go to bed soon. I am feeling tired and I will probably be bored in class tomorrow.</p>
<p>Thanks Lisa and Anne (and <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">roomies</span>) for letting us crash there.</p>
