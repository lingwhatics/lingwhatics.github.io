<p>Thankfully these trees have not been cut down yet. The university seems to be on an anti-tree mission recently. Well really since the middle of the summer. But it got worse last weekend when most of the trees on the east and north sides of the Dining Centre were removed. These were taken for construction but it doesn't change that they are now gone and won't be replaced.</p>
<p>Oh also, I'm done exams.</p>
