<p>Well I haven't written much worth reading since I came home. So today I will. Sort of.</p>
<p>I got my first two marks back.  Two A- in my syntax and typology classes. This is great news because I need a B+ average in my linguistics classes. Oh and I got IP in English presumably that has something to do with it being a full year course and it isn't some new grade that is less than F.</p>
<p>Anyway I keep getting home very late then I get woken up at like 9 because my mum needs me to run errands.  So I'm getting more tired everyday of my holiday.  (Yeah that makes sense!) I think I will get to my work for the day. Gas the car and wash it if it actually gets to 5 degrees (though I will settle for 2).</p>
<p>State: Getting tired.<br />
