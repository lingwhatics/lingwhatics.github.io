I got up at a reasonable hour this morning and headed out to see what happened if I crossed to the south shore. First, a bit of exploration of Parc Jean-Drapeau and then had to wait for a couple ships to pass under a lift bridge. By the time the bridge was lowered there were ~20 cyclists on my side waiting to cross and 60+ on the other side. A very popular activity for the beautiful day.

My ride continued out to Longueuil and then back across Pont Jacques-Cartier before ducking down to the Old Port on my way home.

Total trip distance: 29.92 km
