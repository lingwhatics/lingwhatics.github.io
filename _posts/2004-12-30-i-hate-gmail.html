<p>I was going to change a bunch of stuff tonight, but then I got caught up trying to get my gmail to work apparently it won't work anymore, and it won't give me the right forgotten password question, and claims that I set a yahoo.com address as my secondary address, the problem being that I don't have one of those and haven't for a very long time. Stupid piece of junk, I hope that they can help me or else I will have to get a new invite from my brother or someone, hopefully my account will disappear then and I can have the same address though that is unlikely.<br /></p>
