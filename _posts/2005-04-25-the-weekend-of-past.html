<p>I had an ok weekend. Friday night, Jamie and Meghan came over with Vietnamese subs which were excellent. They watched a movie in my room while I installed a laminate floor in my brother's room and it turned out pretty good considering I hadn't ever done it before and yea.</p>
<p>Saturday I put a floor in my room and then promptly said I quit because it didn't quite turn out the right size even though I measured and calculated the size I needed. So I think somebody is coming to put in the rest of the basement soon-ish. Anyway Saturday night I talked to Heather, drank a slurpee and watched the first part of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Corporation</span>, which I borrowed from the library.</p>
<p>I reorganised my room, it is much nicer now. Kind of symmetrical in that I have my bed in one corner going along the long wall and my desk and bureau going along the opposite wall on the kiddy corner.</p>
<p>I should really get to bed. I have to work tomorrow and have an interview at UC Parking Services.</p>
<p>Song: Whodini - Billy and the Lost Boys<br />Book: <span style="font-style:italic;">Why I Hate Canadians</span>, going on to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Manticore</span> by Robertson Davies</p>
