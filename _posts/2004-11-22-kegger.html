<p>So this weekend it seemed like there was nobody here in residence. This wasn't really the case though. Anyway, Saturday night a bunch of us went to a kegger which was pretty fun. The only bad part was on the way home I decided to jump onto a curb and managed to hit my elbow into the sidewalk. Surprisingly, I only hit the one elbow, and it doesn't seem that anything else hit the ground hard enough to make a mark or bruise. Overall, it was a fun night.</p>
<p>This week my plan is to write my Latin American Studies paper, and hopefully get some advertisements for my linguistics project. Also, I should really start sending out resumes for jobs, especially if I hope to work at the U of C.</p>
