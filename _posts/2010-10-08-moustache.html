<p>I will be participating in Movember this year. "But Daley," you say, "you don't wear hair on your face." That is generally true, except for the last few weeks, when it has made an appearance. It may have even been trimmed.<br />

<p>That really isn't the important part. The important part is that you should all donate to the cause, which is men's health specifically fighting prostate cancer. You can donate in support of my efforts on my <a href="http://ca.movember.com/mospace/542470/">Movember site</a>. I will, of course, remove this moustache and beard just before the start of November and post progress photos over the month. I'm also thinking that this should be a moustache only affair because the full package is easy to pull off well. It takes style to wear a moustache alone.</p>
<p>To recap: I will grow a moustache in November, which is why they call it Movember. And you will donate to Prostate Cancer Canada in support of my rocking a moustache.</p>
