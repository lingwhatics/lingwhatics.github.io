<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	The Beaches International Jazz Festival was on this past week and Friday night we went to the streetfest. Streetfest is fun with bands playing along the street. The crowd didn't seem as thick as last year, and it didn't rain.</p>
<p>Saturday, we went down to T &amp; T for some tasty food. However, before we made it there the sky opened up on us. We had our jackets but that didn't help our shorts, which were soaked. Having wet shorts was only a little annoying when walking down the freezer aisles. With our purchases Heather made vietnamese tonight and it was good.</p>
