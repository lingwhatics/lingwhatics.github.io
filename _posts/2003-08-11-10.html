<p>Another Sunday is upon us and that can only mean one thing, i haven't a clue what that is but one day i will figure it out.  So only a week until Rhoda and Meghan come home.  And probably two weeks until i go to Edmonton.  Wow,  I am so glad that school is almost going to start i don't know if i could've managed muc more summer 'vacation.'  It hasn't been much of a vacation, mostly because I had to work.  Don't get me wrong I like painting it's almost theraputic but at the same time having picky clients who don't understand anything about painting is supremely aggravating.</p>
<p>Ah well.  So life is exciting. I am hoping to order my new eMac tomorrow and it will be a very pretty white colour, though i wish they offered it in something like Navy.  </p>
<p>Feeling: Impatient (maybe this is a state of being but no matter)<br />
