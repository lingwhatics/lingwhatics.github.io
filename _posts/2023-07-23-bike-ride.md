A beautiful Sunday morning for another ride up to Vieux-Rosemont. This time with the whole family. We explored new streets and admired the old houses mixed with newer row houses. We even stopped at a playground that had both shade and not sand. Before heading home we got delicious croissants from Miche & carr√© (2216 Bd Rosemont), but they sadly do not have their apparently delicious pizza on weekends.

Total trip distance: 25.59 km

Moving time: 2h 08m
