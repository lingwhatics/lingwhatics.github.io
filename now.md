What am I up to these days? (2018-12-29)

Where: Toronto

What and Why: 

- Keeping up my goal of reading 30 books a year. Recently, I finished "The Library Book" by Susan Orlean, which had great stories/history of the Los Angeles Public Library and a reminder how important the library is in communities.
- Continuing to learn R to apply it to data analysis and graphic creation at work and home. 
- I gave a talk at work about visualization to get everyone thinking about improving the level of visual communication. I included information about colour visual deficiencies that was well received by several people who commented that they alway have trouble because most people don't think about their needs.
- Travelled to Chicago with my sister and Montreal with a friend in the past year for long weekends.
- Travelled to Calgary and Banff to tour around with my girlfriend (at the time).
- Keeping up my Portuguese learning because it is interesting and maybe one day it will be useful too.

What's Next:

- Planning trips for the next year or so (Brazil, LA, to be determined)
- Trip home for my grandmother's 100th birthday
- Practicing my French so I can conceivably work in Montreal

Idea for this came from [Peter](https://ruk.ca/content/what-am-i-doing-now "What am I doing /now").
