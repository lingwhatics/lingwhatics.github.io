<p>It's official my GPA is 3.46 for the year, which is a step in the right direction. 0.01 higher now that it was after the fall semester.</p>
<p>My work is going pretty well. Currently, I'm working on a computer model of an airport gate area. It was working nicely yesterday until I noticed that I had planes passing through each other, which apparently doesn't happen in real life. So I changed some things and now it doesn't work so correctly. Oh well. Trial and error is how some things end up working.</p>
<p>While out walking the other day, Heather and I discovered some old sidewalk. One direction was set in <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/dalmond/147428115/">1913</a> and the other direction was <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/dalmond/147428690/">1929</a>. It was impressive. It isn't cracked or falling apart in anyway.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to work for me. I kinda wish I had a tablet so I could draw these things more easily.</p>
