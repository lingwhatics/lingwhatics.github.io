<p>We got new internet today. We are now using TekSavvy and the transition was seamless.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a title="A bit in the corner by dalmond, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dalmond/3806405866/"><img src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2552/3806405866_553eaf9840.jpg" alt="A bit in the corner" width="375" height="500" /></a></div>
<p>Took this among 170 or so other shots last night and got 4 with lightning strikes in them.</p>
