<p>Tomorrow is the day of my first quiz in Probability and Statistics. It is solely on probability and I think I know what is going on in that class, but I'm not certain. Most of the questions that I tried today worked out fine.</p>
<p>Tonight I worked. It was uneventful for me. So far, I'm not scheduled until Sunday night, which should be a hoot or not. It will be dead that night, at least I'm pretty sure it will be because the university is closed on the Monday and it is Thanksgiving. I am also probably working on the Monday, which is fine by me because I don't plan on doing any work that day. It is a real holiday.</p>
<p>It seem that the time has come for me to start doing real work. I mean I have kept up on most of my class readings but there were a few things that I haven't finished yet. However, I think that if I actually do work then I will get good mars in my classes, and by good I mean better than if I follow my normal program of not doing enough work at all.</p>
<p>Heather and I went to the <a href="http://www.calgaryzoo.org/">Zoo</a> on Saturday, and we bought passes so that we can go back. It was a fun trip I will probably post some pictures from it tomorrow. I have to go through them to find the gems. My plan is to use my whole Flickr bandwidth this month.</p>
<p>I should get to bed, as I have to go to a tutorial tomorrow morning so I have time to read my article for my other class before my quiz. Anyway... I'm sure there is more to follow.</p>
