<p class="flickr-yourcomment">I'm free on reading week in Toronto, so I went to see the "Palace of Purification." There was no tour, but I did get some nice photos and walked inside the fence. Unlike in Calgary, where they don't really want you anywhere near the plant, at all, ever.</p>
<p>Having a good time here. Have to do some work tomorrow, but then I'm free again until Sunday.</p>
