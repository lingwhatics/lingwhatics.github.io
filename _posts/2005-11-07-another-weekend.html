<p>I thought I should write something about my busy weekend. I worked Saturday night and it was quite busy. And today was the football game and a large concert so it was really busy.</p>
<p>Friday night, Heather and I went to Harvey's for dinner and came to my house to listen to music. Later we went over to Jamie's and watched <span style="font-style:italic;">Super Troopers</span>. It was enjoyable. Saturday afternoon, I drove Heather to work and went to the library, then to work. After work, I went to Heather's and we watched the end of the hockey game, which Calgary won. Then today we got up at like noon and I went to work. And here I am writing.</p>
<p>I guess that's all for now.</p>
<p>Book: <span style="font-style:italic;">What's the Matter With Kansas</span> - Thomas Frank<br />Song: Santa Monica - Bedouin Soundclash (who are playing at MacHall soon)</p>
