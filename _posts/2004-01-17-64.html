<p>Well a party was had and it was pretty good. There was the necessary drunk idiot who broke stuff, and the five people bickering over what music we should listen to.  As a result of them we only listened to like 20 seconds of any song before it got switched.</p>
<p>Lisa will say that I was drunk, which may be true but I could walk and talk and use vocabulary, and my head wasn't spinning so I think I was doing very well for so much in so little time. Then we went for food at <em>Boston Pizza</em>.  Of course that was after I talked on the phone for a long time.</p>
<p>I am tired now since I only slept for a few hours, maybe 3 maybe 3.5. So I think I will retire to a nap and think of something more to write later.</p>
<p>Oh yea yesterday was a great day, almost an excellent one.</p>
