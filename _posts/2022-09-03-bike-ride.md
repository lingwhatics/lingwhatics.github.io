A nice morning to get out biking. After running into a work colleague as we rode past her building, we passed through St-Henri, stopped at Home Depot and then took the path along the A20. The path is gravel and runs along a nice wooded area. We continued on toward the start of Lachine and came back along the canal with another stop at Atwater for lunch.

Total trip distance: 20.47 km

Moving time: 1h 30m
