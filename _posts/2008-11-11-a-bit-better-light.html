<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	On Halloween, I went to the university late to get some photos of the buildings in the dark. This is International House, as far as it was completed then. </p>
<p>For a campus talking about sustainability (which I consider a bad word because it is of course meaningless), there are many too many lights alight at 11pm on a Friday night. I'm not even talking about the residence buildings. There were lights on in the Education Tower, Scurfield Hall, Engineering, ICT and so on. I'm certain that there were not people in most of those rooms.</p>
<p>I've noticed light switch stickers popping up around campus which say "Lights Off, Sustainability On." It is a nice sentiment, if only the campus community (as they like to call it) would act on it. Once buildings are locked there should be a procedure for getting the lights out.</p>
