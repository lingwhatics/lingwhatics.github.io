<p>It has been a busy week or it has seemed like a busy week. I got quite a bit of writing done on my project and finally have the data I need for my project. It will take me a bit of time to work through the data and tease out what it wants to tell me, but I'm glad that I'm no longer waiting for it to arrive.</p>
<p>In other news, I got a domain this week at <a title="Daley's new website" href="http://lingwhatics.ca">lingwhatics.ca</a>.Â  It took me quite a while to actually get around to getting one.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, I went out for a walk near Front and Spadina. I came across this patio and it might be a nice place to get a bite in the warmer weather.</p>

<p>It is fairly neat that people thought to make a database of Jeopardy and analyze the trends. <em>What is Australia?</em></p>
