<p>La La La... I had a good day because I had a slurpee before lunch. And the day went downhill from there. As a result I have sworn off telling stories, well I guess I will tell them since I am presently. Umm.. make a long story short... I had a good rant/venting walk with Lisa and I am good now.</p>
