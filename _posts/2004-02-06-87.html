<p>Yea, yea, yea... my posting has become less frequent than it had been during January, but it isn't my fault.  A valid point that I am the only person who can logon and post, but in my defense maybe I don't have anything to say. Or I guess nothing that I feel the need to share at this point. </p>
<p>I'm sure I will start posting again more frequently, in the not too distant future. Once I figure some things.</p>
