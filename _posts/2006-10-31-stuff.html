<p>Lots of stuff has been happening over the last week or so. Last Tuesday, Heather and I went to see CB's play, <span style="font-style:italic;">Baal</span> at the University Theatre. I enjoyed it. The acting was good and the story was really strange. If you get a chance before Saturday you should see it.</p>
<p>Friday, we watched C.R.A.Z.Y., which was really good. This was after we tried to get pizza, but the guy told us that it would take an hour or more before it would be ready. We decided that was too long. We went to Touch of Ginger in Kensington. It was really good. And I'm sure we will go again.</p>
<p>Saturday and Sunday nights, I had to work parking because of Tragically Hip concerts and probably something to do with pre-Halloween parties. After work Saturday, Heather came over and we hung out and watched the hockey game.</p>
<p>Today, I had my first midterm and I got 79% on it. I should have done better but didn't so oh well. I can do better on other things in the course. I have another midterm tomorrow (Tuesday) morning in Geology. It should be good since I have studied for that one.</p>
<p>Song: Wind It Up - Barenaked Ladies, Summer Skin - Death Cab for Cutie<br />Book: <span style="font-style:italic;">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</span> - Robert Louis Stevenson</p>
