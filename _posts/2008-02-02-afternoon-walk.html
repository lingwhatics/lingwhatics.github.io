<p>Went for a short walk around the block yesterday at work. It was snowing and just after this point all the parents in the office were called and told the schools were closed and they had to come get their kids... There was a small amount of snow. It was silly. The poor snowed in people here... wait I walked around the block and my shoes didn't have snow up to the laces even though the sidewalk hadn't been cleared. Oh well.</p>
