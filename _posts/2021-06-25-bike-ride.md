Overcast day, but still 28 degrees. Ride over the St Lawrence to the south shore to see a new path or two. Figured out that it is 10 km from my place to the opposite side of the Champlain Bridge going the shortest route on ÃŽle des soeurs.

Total trip distance: 34.66 km

Moving time: 1h 58m

Zoomed in image of the ride.
