<p>Alright, so I may not have written last night, but I honestly thought I had. Oh well, not much I can do about it now. </p>
<p>I spent much of last night reading random news articles on the internet. As a result I have learned much more random knowledge. I have also through much thought decided that I know who this "God" character on Joe's blog is, but I shan't say who because it would just be conjecture. </p>
<p>I should really "study" for my mid-terms that are in two weeks, but I'm not sure that they are close enough yet to motivate me.</p>
