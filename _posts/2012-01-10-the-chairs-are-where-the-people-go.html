My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/250492087">4 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>Enjoyable meandering through thoughts and stories. My favorite parts are “Asking a Good Question”, ”Conferences Should Be an Exhilarating Experience” and “Failure and Games”.</p>
<p>Asking a Good Question should be presented as part of an introduction to most or all public lectures that will have a Q&amp;A portion afterward.</p>
