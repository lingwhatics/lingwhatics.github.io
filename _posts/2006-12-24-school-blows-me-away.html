<p>This morning, (Saturday) I checked my grades on InfoNet and my Enviro mark was posted: A+. That's right another variety of A. So far A, A, A-, A+. Somehow my marks became brilliant this semester. I'm told that I was before but my grades didn't really display that, if it was even true.</p>
<p>In other news, I slept in until 11.30 on Saturday which was amazing. I haven't slept that late well forever. Perhaps when Heather and I went to Edmonton. Oh we want to go again in January... if anybody wants to hang out with us. We might go to a lacrosse game.</p>
<p>Should sleep, late...</p>
