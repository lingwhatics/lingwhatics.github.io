<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	Sunday, Heather and I went down to St. Lawrence Market to see Woof Stock. This shot is of the Dock Dogs competition. The point is to have the longest jump into the water. It was neat to watch and the sun was beating down with 32 degree temperatures. </p>
<p>Later, we walked on the waterfront and went up for a really late lunch at the Duke of York. It was such a hot day, but a great change from cool wind and threatening to rain.</p>
