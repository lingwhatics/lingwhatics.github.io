<p>On Saturday we went to Peterborough to see this... the lift lock. It is the tallest hydraulic lift lock in the world. (19.8 metres if i remember the sign correctly.) It was a nice drive. Nice to get out to the city and walkabout though we only walked a little. We drove the 4th line road from Millbrook for a long time and ended up on Steeles Avenue. Who knew that the 4th line turned into Steeles. Or that Steeles is the 4th line.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was a nice day trip.</p>
