# 2017: Year in Review

We've reached the end of 2017 and it is time to look back at things that happened.

I travelled even more than last year. For pleasure, I met my sister in Montreal for a 4 day weekend and we ate all the food, then I went home to Calgary where I saw many people. For work, I went to Los Angeles six times, to Manchester, UK once (5 days) and to Calgary once (a day trip!!). All this travel happened on 22 flights that covered ~62,000 km.

I cooked and baked some new things: 
- strawberry yogurt flapjacks,
- a couple brussel sprout recipes (spicy sesame with peanuts, maple bacon)
- another version of p√£o de queijo, and
- late summer vegetable soup.

I read a bunch of good books ([see my goodreads page](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/7051873 "2017 books"))

I made fewer contributions to the Open Street Map, but kept up some [Missing Maps](http://www.missingmaps.org "Missing Maps") tasks, [HOT tasks](http://tasks.hotosm.org "Humanitarian OpenStreetMaps Team task manager") and random additions to Brazil. See [where I have been mapping](http://yosmhm.neis-one.org/?dalmond "Daley's OSM heat map") and zoom in to see the areas in more detail.

My favorite photos that I took:
