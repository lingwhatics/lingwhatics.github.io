<p>Last night I finally went to see <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/control_room/"><span style="font-style:italic;">Control Room</span></a>, a movie about <a href="https://english.aljazeera.net/HomePage">AlJazeera</a> and their reporting (mostly during the Iraq invasion). It was a very thought provoking movie.</p>
<p>I didn't do much else yesterday. I went to the dentist and didn't have any cavities, mowed a lawn, and did some organizing in the basement. We finally got our carpets cleaned in the basement, well mainly the one in my room which was soaked a few weeks ago. So, today I can move my bed and other things back into my room, which will also give ma a chance to go through my stuff and get rid of junk.</p>
