<p>Updates are sometimes just too much work. All that typing and you know you don't always feel like writing stuff (or maybe that's remember what you wanted to write).</p>
<p>Let's see lots has happened since I last wrote anything on here. (Well last night doesn't count.) I am taking a intermediate Spanish class, which is pretty fun even if some of the people in the class are less than brilliant. Last weekend I stained a fence and it wasn't too bad. Although, it did remind me that I really don't like painting outside. I like painting inside because it is a finite area even if it may not seem to be at the beginning. (Yes, outside is finite too but it just does not seem that way.)</p>
<p>So Wednesday morning I went out to apply for jobs and at the second place I dropped off my resume I got one. I am a dishwasher at <a href="https://www.juliosbarrio.com/">Julio's Barrio</a>, which isn't open yet but it will be open on June 1st. Of course most of you know that I like the nachos there. So, now I get to work there, it should be fun.</p>
<p>I was going to write something else but it is gone. Oh well, I think it had something to do with the Telanovela that we watched a snippet of in Spanish...</p>
