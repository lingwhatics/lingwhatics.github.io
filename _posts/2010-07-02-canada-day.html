<p>Dear Ontario... unless you were driving yesterday, you probably didn't pay more because of HST. If you went to a restaurant you paid less on drinks and the same on good. I guess you could've gotten a manicure but that wasn't really necessary was it? Anything you got at the mall was the same price; there wasn't a new HST on your jeans, those had PST+GST before so the price was the same.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a well spend Canada Day. In the morning, we headed down to the tall ship festival on the harbourfront. We didn't bother with going on board. The crowds were quite large.</p>

<p>After a walk home past a Chinese community Canada Day parade, we got home for an calm afternoon before the Toronto FC game. It wasn't a great game, but there was a dust-up giving two players red cards and another a yellow.</p>

<p>The day ended with a show by <a href="http://www.thesadies.net/">the Sadies</a> at the Harbourfront Centre. It was a good time. Once the Ontario Place fireworks started enough people left the seating area, so we could sit for the end of the show.</p>
