<p>I am currently taking a stop from working on my oral presentation on my research sub-field for my LING 501 course. The problem is I'm not sure that what I am preparing is really what is wanted. The questions that I am to address are straight forward but not, at the same time. It doesn't help that I'm not exactly sure what it is that I am researching yet. It is sort of a non-concrete idea still.</p>
<p>I really can't stand when assignments have short dates, some people just don't prepare presentations well and having only a week to prepare it doesn't help that. Last year I did prepare and research my presentation stuff in 9 days but I had thought about the issue before that and had done some reading on the topic. Thus far I haven't really been able to pin down from which angle I want to address the problem and the available journal articles haven't been useful. Mostly because the literature searches I have done haven't come up with related articles.</p>
<p>I guess I just won't let this stress me now since it doesn't matter all that much at this point since I can work on it tomorrow after my two midterms.</p>
<p>Song: Say It Ain't So - Weezer<br />Book: Yea, there are a few.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">[EDIT]</span><br />The University of Alberta Library's online journal database for language and linguistics has to have the worst design of any tool I have ever attempted to use. It may even be less useful than say a glass with a million tiny holes in it to reduce the overall weight.</p>
