<p class="flickr-yourcomment">Special Parking for... Nothing. You know why? Because nothing large happens outside of summertime on the waterfront. That won't stop Waterfron(t)Toronto from pretending that it is a hip and happening place all year round. (I wish there was another 't' in the name)</p>
<p>Of all the people I saw down there, who weren't skating, one was an obvious tourist, a few were joggers and the others were walking their dogs. I am willing to bet the dog walkers live down there because there isn't lots of space down there.</p>
