<p>h'okay! So after Friday night of partying but only drinking a bit, I went out last night with some people from Rez. It was quite fun, but I think in Rez drinks are bigger or something because those drinks got me pretty quickly. Anyway, I didn't sleep much last night, again. It is still early tonight so maybe I will go to bed at a ridiculously early hour. Maybe I will try 8.30, this may backfire and I will just wake up at like 5 and not be able to sleep anymore. I will figure this out.</p>
<p>So I got milk and cereal this afternoon, and after eating some I went  to bed for 3 hours. That was a good sleep once I forgot that I felt kinda sick. I will feel better, and I won't get sicker.</p>
<p>I am currently listening to mellow music, and I really don't think that it is making me any more awake. I think I will go be an old person and get my bag ready and try to sleep</p>
