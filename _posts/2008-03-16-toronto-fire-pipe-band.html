<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	After taking Heather's laptop to the (Cr)Apple Store to explain why it became possessed, we happened upon a St Patrick's Day Parade (well day before parade) on Yonge street. We saw most of it we think. It seemed short but to make it go faster we walked up Yonge opposite the flow of the parade. This photo is the Toronto Fire Pipe Band. </p>
<p>It was fairly sunny out today though much windier than yesterday. Thankfully by mid-week it will be warm and less windy, so the snow can keep melting away.</p>
