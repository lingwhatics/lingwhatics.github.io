<p>So far this week I have gone to the library. I honestly think that is the extent of me actually doing anything useful. I did go to classes and do my readings but as far as moving along to work going to the library was it.</p>
<p>Other than that, I have gone to Safeway, where I got some really good and inexpensive smoked salmon.</p>
<p>I am going to Calgary for thanksgiving, so we should plan to do stuff people who will be there.</p>
<p>Song: Popular - Nada Surf<br />
<br />Book: B LAW text, Economics text and Latin American Studies readings<br /></p>
