<p>Tonight, I saw <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362270/"><span style="font-style:italic;">The Life Aquatic</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">with Steve Zissou</span></a> and it was an odd movie at best, though I did like the ending. I should really go to bed. I applied for a few jobs today at the university and might apply for some other places tomorrow.</p>
<p>I'm off to bed.</p>
<p>Song: West Coast Rain - Captain Tractor<br />Book: <span style="font-style:italic;">Plan B</span> (the last section)</p>
