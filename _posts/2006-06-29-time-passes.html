<p>So, it has been a bit longer than I was going to take. I have done many things since my last post. I actually went to see <a href="https://climatecrisis.net"><span style="font-style:italic;">An Inconvenient Truth</span></a>.  And it was a scary movie. I suppose there were lots of graphs which could be taken out of proportion but why would you lie about climate change.</p>
<p>Last Friday, Rhoda had a house warming party. That was a fun time. We all played <span style="font-style:italic;">Cranium</span> which I think is getting a bit old as a game. Next time, I hope that we will have the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Canadian Trivia Game</span>. Heather and I had a nice walk to Kensington from there and I managed to catch the last bus home.</p>
<p>I feel like I got up the next morning and watched the World Cup game that was on and then mowed the lawn. I also worked. After work, I went to Heather's and we watched most of a <span style="font-style:italic;">Bridge Too Far</span>. And finished it in the morning over waffles. We followed that up with a walk through downtown. (As always the photos are on <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/dalmond/">flickr</a>.)</p>
<p>I got a new project Monday for engineering work and started painting my aunt's kitchen at night. Tuesday, we had a good dinner and walk over at my dad's.</p>
<p>Tonight, Tyson and I played some video games. It was great to not have to do anything strenuous. I get the joy of working the next three nights, so I don't think there will be many video games.</p>
