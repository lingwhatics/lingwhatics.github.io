<p>Blog blog blog... Yea, so today wasn't so bad. There was this cool fog when I left for school and it stuck around all day and got thicker by the time I actually came home. Although, I did feel like I couldn't use my lung capacity properly. It felt like I was breathing shallowly. It was interesting but I got over it by the time classes were over. Well mostly...</p>
<p>Let's see... I don't really know what I want to write here today. I had a good afternoon. :)</p>
<p>Song: Straw Dog - Something Corporate<br />
<br />State: Good, heading to bed to rest up before my morpho midterm</p>
