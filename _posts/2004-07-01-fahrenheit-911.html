<p>Tonight, we went down to the Globe Cinema and saw Fahrenheit 9/11. It was really quite a good movie. I enjoyed it, but some of the things in the movie make one quite annoyed with... let's say people's lack of intelligence. (Also, I really enjoyed that I didn't have to go to The Other Big Chain of theatres, not <i><a href="http://www.cineplex.com/">Cineplex</a></i>.) The part that annoyed me the most were the soldiers who said things like "I hate Iraq" or "I can't understand why the hate us, we are here to liberate them". Nothing against them they may have taken too much brainwash serum.</p>
<p>One of my companions after the movie was saying how the world was screwed up and we couldn't help anybody but ourselves, well that isn't exactly what she said but close enough. If she cares to clarify she can. Anyway, it went that in this economy we couldn't help anybody. Saying ever since this economy started things have been bad, but I dunno... way back when the first trade was made, I don't think things were so bad. They probably were really happy that they no longer had to grow everything that they needed to survive, and that the responsibility could be shared among a larger group. Which of course would have brought along clans, and hierarchies with the ensuing necessity to enact the present systems of government (well, I may have boiled the sap a bit fast but that's the basic idea). I think that we can do something here and away, and that it doesn't have to be hard.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have to work in the morning so I need to be off to bed.</p>
