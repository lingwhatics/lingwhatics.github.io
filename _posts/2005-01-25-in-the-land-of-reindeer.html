<p>These are the reindeer that we always used to put up on our front fence at Christmas. Now they get put up on my dad's deck railing. They look nice at night with a set of lights strung on top of them, and of course the light on the very front is red. We always have ignored the fact that we don't have enough deer to have a Rudolph.</p>
