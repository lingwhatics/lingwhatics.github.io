<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	We waited a while today for the Queen streetcar after having lunch at Rivoli for Heather's pre-birthday birthday. So, I captured this cyclist moving very slowly through slush. And there is so much slush because in Toronto there are three ways to "remove" snow and I will present them in order of general preference:<br />(1) Cover in salt<br />(2) Wait until it melts<br />(3) Last resort, clear it with a shovel</p>
