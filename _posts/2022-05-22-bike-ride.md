Family ride up to Jean-Talon because it's rhubarb season. We also enjoyed a little walk on Bernard with a bahn mi and delicious doughnuts. Doris got a flat on the wheel that didn't get a flat yesterday. Thankfully after we dropped off the bike the store agreed that both wheels getting flats from the inside in a couple days is more than a bit suspicious.

Total trip distance: 17.34 km

Moving time: 1h 18m
