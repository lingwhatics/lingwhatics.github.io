<p>Just a short entry for now... Perhaps a longer one later. Yesterday was the last day of classes and for the first time ever, I went to my classes... Usually I don't go to any of them, but I attended all of them. It was not too bad.</p>
<p>Tonight I'm going with Heather out to Julio's to celebrate Lisa's birthday. Should be fun, I really like that restaurant even though I always buy the same thing.</p>
