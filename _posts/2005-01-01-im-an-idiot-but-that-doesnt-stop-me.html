<p>That's it! I have decided that I am not going to do anything this year. Nothing because it doesn't seem to matter what I do I still ruin it. Usually for the other <a href="https://brezo.blogspot.com/2005/01/things-i-should-have-learned-by-now.html">person</a> or people involved. I'm sure people know what I am talking about. I wish I didn't but I always seem to. Even in the past I have done it. Usually just before they leave for a trip or something when I know it will have time to set in before they come back, but of course people don't want to know things before they go they want to know them long before they are going or when they come back. The only good thing is that by the time they come back they are more inclined to talk to me. Woop-de shit who cares since it doesn't change anything.</p>
