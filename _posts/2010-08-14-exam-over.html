<p>Today, I wrote my professional practice exam, so if all went well I won't have to write more exams any time soon. I am now going to get my thesis going at a faster speed. Working on rain derived inflow and infiltration into sanitary sewer pipes is going well, and it is nice to get out of developing a proposal mode and on to the building mode.</p>

<p>In other news, we got new sidewalks around our place. They have been sort of cut up and patched since before we moved in last year. They also appear to be repaving the road as well and it will be nice to have the utility work done.</p>

<p>Hopefully, something fun will happen tomorrow and it will still be nice out.</p>
