<p>I was going to write something useful today when I got home from work but I was tired and had forgotten what I was going to write about. Probably something about people complaining too much about things that are beyond their control, like how many customers come into a place of business and how this affects the staff's workload.</p>
<p>I think that was what I was going to write about but i don't feel like it anymore so I am just going to take a nap...</p>
