<p>I went to Home Depot after work today to drop off my application. Oddly, I had the worst service I have ever had there. I had to wait for quite a while while random employees talked amongst themselves about what I hope was the customer in front of me's problem, but I am pretty sure that it wasn't about that at all.</p>
<p>Tonight, Heather, Jamie and I watched <span style="font-style:italic;">Beyond Borders</span>, which despite my dislike of Angelina Jolie was a pretty good movie. It was very twisty and turny. A few of the things I saw coming a few others I didn't until they were just about to happen.</p>
<p>I have the awful smell of seafood in black bean sauce from lunch today stuck in my nose, I didn't eat it I just served it. I ate a roast beef and cheddar sandwich and it tasted much better than the seafood smelled.</p>
<p>Song: Mission Bell - Tariq<br />Book: <span style="font-style:italic;">Before the Flood</span> - Alan R. Wilson</p>
