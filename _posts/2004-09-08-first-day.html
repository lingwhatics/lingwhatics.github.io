<p>Today was the start of classes and I like 75% of the classes I went to. I guess that is pretty good. I am trying to changed the 4th class but the class I want to be in is full and I am not sure if I will be able to get into it. I am going to talk to the prof about the full class tomorrow after my seminar, and hopefully things will work out.</p>
<p>I am taking Business Law 301, which is an overview of contract law and tort in the Canadian Legal system. It seems like it will be a good class. The professor seems like a good one, who is actually interested in what he is teaching. My next good class is Latin American Studies 205, which is about Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. It seems like it will be good, except that we seem to be leaving out Haiti as part of the discussion, though I may have just missed it on the outline. Finally, I have Economics 101, which is microeconomics. It will be a fine class. I read some of the text yesterday when I bought it and liked it.</p>
<p>The floor seems to be opening up a bit I met a handful of people yesterday, so that was good.</p>
<p>There isn't really that much else that I have to talk about... I had smoked salmon for dinner last night. It was really good, and it wasn't expensive.</p>
<p>I also bought books for the classes that I am know I am staying in today. Tonight I am going to Ikea because there is a free bus for people who live in Residence.</p>
