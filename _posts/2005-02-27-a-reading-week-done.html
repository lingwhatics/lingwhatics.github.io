<p>This is the end of my reading week. Heather just left to go back to Edmonton. We did some fun things while she was here. Saw a bunch of movies. Went to a party at Melissa's. Walked around to a few places. And most importantly went to the Lacrosse All-Star game.</p>
<p>The All-Star game was quite fun. Though the fans were really biased towards the West team since it was in Calgary. There were a handful of people cheering for the East. It was kind of sad that for the game there were about 5000 empty seats, but oh well not much anybody can do about that.</p>
<p>I think I will leave this here for now. I am going to actually do some practice questions for my Engg Econ quiz on Wednesday.</p>
