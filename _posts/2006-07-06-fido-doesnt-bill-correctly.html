<p>I just got off the phone with Fido for the second month in a row because they charged me for things that are included in my plan. If it didn't cost so much to buy out of my contract I would because my time is worth more than they might think having me on hold 28 minutes this time. (It was longer last time).</p>
<p>At least this time the guy put in a complaint to the techs saying my service was broken. Last time the guy said he couldn't do that on the first time. Why couldn't you put in a service request on the first time something was broken. That would be like have a light out and not being able to request that it be replaced until it miraculously came back on and then went out again. If it miraculously came back on, I doubt it would be going off again.</p>
<p>Anyway, for anybody who cares, don't bother getting service with Fido/Rogers because they are no good. Also, they are charging 7% GST even though only 2 days of the period were before July 1st, but if I cancelled something on my service it would be credited as the lowest amount possible.</p>
