A hot morning (29C at 10am) and I should've gone out riding earlier so I had a slower ride than usual. A good loop including some new Verdun, and walking up to the new Peel/Wellington intersection where the bike lanes and new wider sidewalks are coming together. 

Total trip distance: 16.33 km

Moving time: 0h 57m

Today's ride:
