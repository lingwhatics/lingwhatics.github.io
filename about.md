This is Daley's blog. I have merged my coding blog and my normal one, but I still plan to post here about fun coding activities and random things that I am trying to learn. By day, I help people plan airports (including some of the biggest in the world). By night, I have the baseball game on while tinkering on the computer or reading a book.
