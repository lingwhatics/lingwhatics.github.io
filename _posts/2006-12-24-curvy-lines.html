<p>Ok... so the thing is that I thought it was done with the long exposure. I thought I had heard the shutter finishing click (or whatever you call that sound), but then I noticed the photo wasn't on the screen and thought I had ruined my cars passing shot. It turned out like this so I was not too disappointed.</p>
