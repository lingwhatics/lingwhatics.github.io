I had to find a new way to record my bike trips since the Toronto Cycling app is no longer available and, well, I'm in a new city. So this is a test using STRAVA exported GPX files.

I missed my first two rides of this year. Number 1 was the last Sunday of May when the Bixi bikes are free. Number 2 was a bike tour of the Plateau/Mile-end led by one of my colleagues from the offie.

On an early Saturday morning, I got out for a ride along the Lachine canal all the way out to Lachine. The early morning meant many spandex clad riders on bikes 3x and 4x more than my single-speed. I could easily make this a regular ride.

Total trip distance: 31.65 km

Obviously, this does not work with the old Toronto rides on it.
