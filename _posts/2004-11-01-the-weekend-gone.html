<p>This weekend was quite unproductive for me. I read two chapters of economics, a handful of pages of one book and 2 chapters of another. That is about all. I chatted with a few people. I seem to have bruised my upper left forearm, and I have no clue how that would have happened.</p>
<p>Last night I was bored after the party broke up and I wasn't ready to go to bed yet, so I went and watched TV in the yellow lounge until 3 something (of the new clock set back an hour time, so 4 of the old time). It wasn't thrilling but it was something to do.</p>
<p>My plan for this week is to do a bunch of BLAW problems and economics problems because I have the one midterm Friday morning and the other the following Monday afternoon. Of course, I will leave time for watching election coverage (read: The Great Debacle of 04).</p>
