<p>It seems that everybody is delayed in posting these days. Last week was a pretty good week. I didn't really get much accomplished on my research project because everything that I did was not correct, and I volunteered at the <a href="https://www.csce.ca/">CSCE</a> conference for a few days. The conference was neat. I got to watch presentations and I even liked some of them. I had a session about landfills; it was interesting, but I wouldn't really want to work on them. There was also a presentation about <a href="https://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CategoryID=19">LEED</a> credits that dealt with how one can acquire credits using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Dixie_Highway_Maitland.jpg">interlocking segmental paving</a> (click for image). It was really cool because I think roads and paths made of that look so neat, and seem like they can easily be fixed if the bricks break or something below them needs replacing.</p>
<p>So far my class has been good. I got an A on the first assignment, where we had to "translate" a technical document into one that lay-people could understand. I have to edit my proposal for the class tomorrow since it is due Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the last day that I don't have to go to the university until at least next Tuesday. I get the pleasure of working Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. It should be fun. I guess it isn't so bad, at least I'm making money.</p>
<p>On the weekend Heather and I went to Ikea. I bought some more plants and she bought some stuff too. We were going to see a movie except that something... I don't really remember why we didn't go. But I think next Tuesday I will go down and see <span style="font-style:italic;">Why We Fight</span>. It is supposed to come out in our theatre on Friday.</p>
<p>That's enough of a disjointed post for me.</p>
