<p><a href="https://www.citynews.ca/news/news_10775.aspx">CityNews: GTA Breaks Record High As Smog Advisory Issued</a><br />It was really nice yesterday (Tuesday). Not too humid yet, so the walk home in 27.7 was glorious. Today, it was only about 20 on the walk home but higher humidity, not as nice.</p>
<p>Work is good so far and I like the people I'm working with. Heather and my apartment is mostly organised. We still have to put the bed back up. The bedroom floor isn't quite even so the slats were loose and we didn't really want to wake up on the floor the first night so we took it apart and haven't had it properly together again. I think that is what is up for after dinner tomorrow.</p>
<p>That's all for the moment. Bed time now.</p>
