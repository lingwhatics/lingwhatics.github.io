<p>Dear Marco's,</p>
<p>You have been replaced. It was A&amp;A on 20th Avenue NW in Calgary. The music was better, The Killers, and the donair was amazingly good. The guys making the food were hilarious and they had pictures of Lebanese cowboys (themselves) riding donkeys, quite amusing.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Satisfied <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donair" rel="tag">donair</a> eater.</p>
