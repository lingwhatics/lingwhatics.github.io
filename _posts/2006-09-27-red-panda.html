<p>Heather and I went to the Zoo on Sunday. It was a nice day out and for some odd reason we took our sweaters, so we had to carry them around all afternoon. On the way out we ran into Clare and Jason.</p>
<p>After my few hours of work today, Heather and I went to Moose McGuire's for some wings and beer. It was tasty and the service was quite good. </p>
<p>Anyway, I thought this was a cute photo. I took it as usual.</p>
