<p>Today, we saw <a href="https://www.mirvish.com/spamalot/" rel="tag"><span style="font-style:italic;">Spamalot</span></a> and <a href="https://www.sonyclassics.com/whokilledtheelectriccar/" rel="tag"><span style="font-style:italic;">Who Killed the Electric Car?</span></a>. They were both good. The first was funny and musical. The second was  great and I'm glad to have seen it here in Toronto because the crowds probably wouldn't be so large and good in Calgary. That's all for now.</p>
