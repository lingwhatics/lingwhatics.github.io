My transit use was still significantly curtailed because of Covid-19 in 2021. The tradition of reporting since 2014 continues. For STM rides I counted "unofficial" transfers as two rides. I took 15 rides in 2021. My rides were paid for using: Presto (2) and OPUS (13).


|Agency |Fare Media | Total Rides| Total Cost ($)|
|:------|:----------|-----------:|----------:|
|STM    |OPUS       |          13|       32.80|
|TTC    |Presto     |           2|        6.40|

Not a whole lot of riding this year.

We took a trip to Toronto in August after we took the baby on her first metro ride in Montreal.

## Year over year
Weekday riding is generally low, except for 2017 when I was seconded to the airport for the summer, but in January and February 2019, I was using transit quite a bit during the week to visit friends. I stopped going to axe throwing league on Sundays from September 2018 so no longer have higher riding on that day.

The pandemic continued to reduce my transit use. So much more walking and occasional drives to start somewhere further away.
