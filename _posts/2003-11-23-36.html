<p>I figure saying things on here is good.  </p>
<p>Well let's just say that I have spent much of the weekend working on a project. A project I should have started quite a while ago, but I think that I have done enough work.  Now all I have to do is prepare a presentation.</p>
<p>What would an oyster do with a pearl?  Why would they make them?</p>
<p>I don't have much more to say today. Oh! I got some new old music today. </p>
<p>Song: Learn To Fly by the Foo Fighters<br />
<br />State: Tired of working on Swahili</p>
