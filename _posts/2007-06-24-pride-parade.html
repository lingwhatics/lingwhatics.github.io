<p>Had a great time Sunday afternoon at the Pride Parade. Got a bit <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">sunburnt</span> but many hours in the sun will do that to you when it is so hot. This photo is of an amazing stilt walker. Anyway off to bed. Hope you all are having fun where ever you are.</p>
