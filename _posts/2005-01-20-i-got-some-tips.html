<p>So far today lots of things have happened. I got up 2 hours later than I had wanted to, but that didn't really do anything except give me less time to do things. First thing I did after checking my e-mail and finding out that both the ENGG department and the ECON dept. would give me consent to take the class I wanted to take. So off to the university I went. Of course, I got to the bus stop just after one bus and 20 minutes before the next, oh well better luck to me next time.</p>
<p>I decided to go to the engineering department first to see if they signed my form before I went to the registrar or the other way around, and thankfully it was them that had to sign it first. This didn't do anything more than stop me from having to trek back and forth between there and the registrar, which was nice even though the distance is small. So I got all registered in Engineering Economics, which I hear isn't such an interesting class. I'll have to see for myself. The first class that I went to was today and it wasn't so bad. Except for the fact that the prof kept saying "last time I said...", it didn't really seem like I had missed any part of the class even though I had missed three lectures. I got the notes for those lectures from my cousin, who is also in the class.</p>
<p>I also talked to Cherrie (I think that is how it is spelled) today. She was off to a lab where she would draw her own blood and analyze it. It sounded a little iffy but that's ok I didn't have to do it. It was nice to talk to her as I haven't seen her since my last LING exam at UofC a year and a half ago.</p>
<p>Oh and I got some beauty tips from moose jaw, finally. Actually, I didn't so much get them as the author recounted the ones he was given when the editor of <span style="font-style:italic;">Flare</span> got him to go to a spa since he had never been. Of course, he had tried to enlist his wife's help in avoiding the spa but she thought it was a good idea. The book is so far quite amusing, and seems like quite an accurate description of the outposts of Canada.</p>
<p>I believe that is all for now.</p>
<p>Song: Daughters - John Mayer (who I still think has a disproportionately large head for his body)<br />Book: <span style="font-style:italic;">Beauty Tips from Moose Jaw</span></p>
<p>[<span style="font-style:italic;">NOTE: spellcheck wants me to make 'UofC' into 'oafs', sometimes that wouldn't be an inaccurate description</span>]</p>
