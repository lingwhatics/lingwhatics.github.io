<p class="flickr-yourcomment"> I'm currently reading a book called <i>Homage to Barcelona</i> by Colm Tóibín. I'm about halfway through and it is quite interesting. Makes me want to go back to see some of the things that I didn't see.</p>
<p>Heather was reading it while we were there and we did see many of the places mentioned. I think I really want to go back because it was so nice there and I got to walk 20km+ per day. Good times.</p>
<p>I really should be reading papers about constructed wetlands, but that is for the weekend.</p>
