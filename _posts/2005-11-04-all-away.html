<p>Finished my last midterm today. It took about 10 minutes and I knew the answers. Much better than the other ones. I just have a couple little things to set up and I'm done my Access lab and I have a few things to fix up in my excel part of the lab and I will have a free weekend. Well, except for the working most of the day Sunday but that will be fine since it is a football game.</p>
