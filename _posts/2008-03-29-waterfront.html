<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	After a trip to Honest Ed's and Vietnamese for lunch, we went down to the beach for some photos. It was really nice down there. I think it helped being in the bright sun.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was a nice walk along the boardwalk and on the sand. There were many people down there and quite a few had dogs.</p>
