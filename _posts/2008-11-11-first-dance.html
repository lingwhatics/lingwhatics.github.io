<p class="flickr-yourcomment">Over the weekend, Heather was here to visit and attend Pat and Steph's wedding (or should that be Steph and Pat's... hmm). It was a fun time. This is a lovely cellphone picture of their first dance.</p>
<p>Heather and I also, had a nice dinner with Rhoda, Meghan, Jaime and Jasmine at Vietnam Fortune. Peter's Milkshakes and Onion Rings. Nellie's Breakfast. All the important food groups.</p>
<p>It was a fun weekend, and now I should get to work on my group project.</p>
