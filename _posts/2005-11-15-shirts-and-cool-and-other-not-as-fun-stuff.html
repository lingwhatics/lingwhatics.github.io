<p>Alright well things seem to be more organised than I thought they were. I have done all the pre-quiz practice questions for Statistics, which is way more than I can say for the probability section of the course. Hopefully this quiz will go significantly better than the ones from probability.</p>
<p>I wrote a bunch of my STAS paper today during my break, but then my laptop battery was getting low so I had to give up on that effort. I looked this evening and found out that I got 9/10 on the last reflection paper for that class, which was a nice surprise. I guess writing all those silly linguistics paper paid off after all. I guess it helped me at UofA too on my LAST Mexico paper.</p>
<p>I got a couple of cool t-shirts from <a href="https://www.threadless.com/?streetteam=dalmond">Threadless.com</a>. I have pictures of them posted on the site <a href="https://threadless.com/profile/198024/dalmond">here</a>.  And I bought another one today, it is the  <a href="https://threadless.com/product/265/My_Pet_Human">My Pet Human</a> one.  Yay, new shirts.</p>
<p>I should get to bed, I have a quiz tomorrow then I have to do a bunch of other work. I get to go to the Flames game on Friday.</p>
