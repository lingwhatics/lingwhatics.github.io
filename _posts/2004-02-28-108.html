<p>Look it's Saturday (I was in that musical once... Oh no wait that was another year... I did <em>When the Hippos Crashed the Dance</em>) Anyway today was alright, although it was completely unproductive until the last half hour.</p>
<p>I don't really know what to write today since I imagine that most of what I have done since the last post is not important to post.</p>
<p><em>if I told you to grow up, would you?</em></p>
<p>Song: King of New York form <em>Newsies</em><br />
<br />State: good but I want nachoes.</p>
