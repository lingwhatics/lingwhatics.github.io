<p>This is from ED 386 at UofC. This is the second time I have a had a class in this room and it isn't that great now, but it was worse before. I had PHIL 279 in this room way back in 2nd year. It didn't really have desks like it does now, it had those chairs with the arm desk. How does that pass off as a desk? I guess they don't anymore since they aren't found many places on campus.</p>
