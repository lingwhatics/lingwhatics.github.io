<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	I went for a walk along the waterfront from Cherry Street to Rees St. Along, this route there are a few side-tracks that are severely over-grown in many places. In addition, the port lands factories and warehouses are gone or slated to be demolished. This may in the long run create a more beautiful waterfront; though I'm not certain that the entire waterfront should be a thing of the subjective "beauty" as dictated by WaterfrontToronto. Hopefully, all these un-used tracks will not become victims of the planned demolition of the Gardiner.</p>
