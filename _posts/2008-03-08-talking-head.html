<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	We saw the Rick Mercer Report last night. It was funny. Much less interactive than Go! but then again it isn't "live" and interactive. There is more emphasis on the stories than on a radio variety show.</p>
<p>It was fun to see and I captured this talking Rick with my 50mm lens. Despite all the lights in the studio it was still hard to get a short enough exposure.</p>
