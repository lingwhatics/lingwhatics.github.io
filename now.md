What am I up to these days? (2020-10-19)

Where: Montreal

What and Why: 

- On Thanksgiving, my wife and I welcomed our lovely baby to this world!!
- I did get to go to the office 8 times in September on my designated days, and it was a great change to start/end the day with a walk.
- French: reading, listening, watching, course.

What's Next:

- Baby things
- Learning to paint (I received watercolours and a large how to paint book for Christmas).
- Figuring out when travel will be possible to see family.

Idea for this came from [Peter](https://ruk.ca/content/what-am-i-doing-now "What am I doing /now").
