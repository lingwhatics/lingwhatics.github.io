<p>I had never seen <span style="font-style:italic;">Napoleon Dynamite</span> before and so I recorded it the other night on CITY. Anyway, I watched it this afternoon and I really have no clue what is so great about the movie... can somebody tell me? seriously.</p>
<p>It wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen but I have seen lots of random pointless movies so it would be hard to be that terrible.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Heather and I went down to Bloor and got some Christmas gifts. It was really quite slushy out. The snow last night paired with the rain today weren't really ideal but at least it wasn't very cold out.</p>
