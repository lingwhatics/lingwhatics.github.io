<p>4 things due in 4 classes between the 26th and the the first.  I guess I should complete them in the order in which they are due.  That's the plan now.</p>
<p>I think that I am worrying too much about the first one. the presentation.  I am not yet worried about the write-up for that project but I guess if I am able to present on the topic I will be able to write about it.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't think that that is what I am nervous/worried about.  At the same time I only have a hint of an idea about what is so worrisome.  Talking to people seems to be the thing that makes me feel better.  I'm not really sure why though because I don't generally like talking to people much.  Which leads to nobody knowing much about me.  I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but it seems to get in the way often.  People want me to tell them things and I can't because I don't tell people things.</p>
<p>Why?  I have no clue why.  There is no reason why I shouldn't want to tell people things.  Maybe it had something to do with never fitting in with people and so I don't really like having people around.  Or maybe when I told people things they didn't know how to not say anything to other people.    I think it was the first thing.  I didn't fit in and thus never have felt like I fit in.  Sure I can pretend that I fit in (I might even fit in and not know), but without knowing for sure I don't think I will talk (for real).</p>
