It was finally time to go get a BANQ library card (who doesn't need cards for both systems in the city?). I went along the Old Port and up the Berri bike lanes. After visiting BANQ, I continued up Berri to Saint-Joseph and then came back down on Saint-Urbain. Not the most exciting ride, but I covered some new streets.

Total trip distance: 15.38 km

Moving time: 0h 59m

Today's ride:
