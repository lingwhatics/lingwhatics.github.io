<p>How eventful a weekend that was. well i guess it was only partially weekend.</p>
<p>Anyway so after 'wasting' half my days sleeping/trying to sleep.  I read a very excellent book (well finished it because the library insisted that i bring it back by today).  <em>Brave New World</em> was a great book and should be read by all.</p>
<p>I also ventured out in the 'normal' temperatures to see the movie <em>City of God</em> on Monday night.  It was quite a good movie. though it did have quite a bit of killing in it, nothing on the order of say <em>Gangs of New York</em>, but a fair amount.</p>
<p>I am really having difficulty understanding how it is only the start of August.  I mean it doesn't seem like the summer has flown by, though at the same time it seems as though time is passing very slowly just to spite me.  I mean if summer were over right now i would be happy. I am so ready for some higher learning or whatever universities try to pass off on us.</p>
