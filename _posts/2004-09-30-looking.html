<p>Today in my research class, it really hit me that what I am doing is of little or no use to anybody "out there." It's a completely self-serving venture which has presented itself in front of me. This doesn't seem like something I want to be doing, at least not overtly. Sure if what I do is underlyingly self-serving and pointless then fine, but to know from the outset that this work is of little value to anybody outside the "Ivory Tower" (bunch of poachers, if you ask me), is really something that doesn't work well for me. Like I think I should be able to figure this out though I'm not sure that I will be able to reconcile with the idea that my endeavours aren't going to help anybody in any way.</p>
<p>Anyway, I also was thinking that people try to stop others from doing things that might be stupid, but then again they don't want to influence the other so much so that you could be blamed after if they don't like the consequences of their decision. That being said maybe we should be more forceful in telling people our opinions when we see something we don't like. It's not up to you if they take your advice but it is up to you to give said advice.</p>
