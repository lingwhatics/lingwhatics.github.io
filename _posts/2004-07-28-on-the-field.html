<p>On my way to Meghan's last night I saw a couple of games of field <a href="https://www.lacrosse.ca">lacrosse</a> going on in a school yard. I was quite impressed that it was being played out here... out here being in the less rich and not as snobby southend of Calgary. I always wasnt to stop and watch for a bit whenever I see games but I haven't yet... maybe next time.</p>
<p> We watched <span style="font-style:italic;">Something's Gotta Give</span> last night and it was intersting. Though not my favorite movie by a far stretch.</p>
<p> I have been playing <span style="font-style:italic;">Settlers 2</span> a bunch over the last few days, it's an interesting game... at least the version I have is in English. My brother's copy seems to be in Czech, which makes it harder for the understanding but we seem to have it figured out.</p>
