<p>Today was probably one of my last days at the Mount Royal bookstore as there doesn't seem to be much of a rush going on anymore for textbooks and tomorrow I might only be working for 3 - 4 hours. It kind of sucks but that will give me the rest of the week to submit applications to companies that I might work for.</p>
<p>I am trying to get something doing data entry with an oil company or an oil service company. It seems like something that I am very capable of doing and I understand that they pay well, which would make my going to school for 3 more years much easier.</p>
<p>At the same time as I am looking for those jobs I am looking for summer engineering jobs that I might be able to do. So far there are a bunch from Petro-Canada but they call for students going into 3rd or 4th year of Chem or Oil&amp;Gas Engineering, which I am not and never will be. Hopefully there will be more posted in the coming weeks. I would really like to do something Civil or Geomatics related because those are the things that I have applied for and I will be doing one of them in the fall semester.</p>
<p>I watched <a href="https://www.cornergas.com/"><span style="font-style:italic;">Corner Gas</span></a> tonight it was amusing even though I had already seen at least part of it. Then Jamie and I watched an episode from my season 1 dvds and it was really funny. I had never seen it before, but I think I have seen all of season 1 now.</p>
<p>I should get to bed as I have to get up in 6 hours to drive my sister to work then go to work myself.</p>
