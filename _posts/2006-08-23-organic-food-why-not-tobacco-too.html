<p>With all the talk of organic foods and making the industry cleaner, I wonder why tobacco hasn't followed suit. It seems like something that could make them look better. Personally, I don't care if tobacco companies look bad or worse but it seems like a logical step for them to try improve the image. Not sure why I thought of this but I did.</p>
