<p>Finished my last exam and it was pretty good. I made a couple small mistakes but I hope they are small enough not to cause real problems.  Like one of the values should have been double and maybe in the other direction. And another value should have been slightly larger because of where I put the centre. It doesn't matter now. I hope that I do as well as the midterm because that was 20% above class average.</p>
<p>Anyway... I done now, and just have to write a paper for my class that starts May 15th... But I have lots of time before that happens.</p>
