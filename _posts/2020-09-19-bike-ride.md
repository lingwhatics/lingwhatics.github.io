I got fed up with my chain jumping off as I rode so I dropped into the bike shop at Saint Columba House. The helpful man there checked my chain and replaced a worn bolt. He declared that while the chain was old, it still had life in it so he improved the tension and sent me on my way. It worked out well on this test ride and the chain didn't jump off any of the rough road spots where it had been the last few rides.

It was a chilly day, but I took a couple new streets and the ride was good.

Total trip distance: 7.66 km

Moving time: 0h 30m

Zoomed in image with a couple new streets which were filled with auto shops up near the aquaduct and water treatment plant.
