<p>Last weekend was a busy one it seems. It wasn't really crazy. Friday night was low key. We had David and Lex over for dinner, hockey and cards.</p>
<p>Saturday, Heather went out in the morning and I took a ride up to St. Clair to get some tortillas and a tamarind Jarrito. I found that riding a bit further down Davenport gives a much shorter and less steep hill. In the evening, we went up to Thornhill for a birthday dinner.</p>
<p>Sunday, we went to the Blue Jays-Yankees game. We were up in the 500 level, so it was a good view of the field. Sadly, it wasn't very nice out so the roof was closed.</p>

<p>I haven't played with my Lensbaby for a while, so I took that with me. I got a few shots I like.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we had a lovely dinner at C'est What.</p>
