<p>I finished my last exam about an hour ago and for the moment, I'm done working at parking. So, I have a month off before I will return to Calgary to work during convocations at parking.</p>
<p>It should be a good time. I'm off to Toronto tomorrow and have a soccer game to attend Sunday afternoon.</p>
