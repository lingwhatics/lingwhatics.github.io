<p>This afternoon, Heather and I went to see <a href="https://www.sonyclassics.com/capote/" rel="tag"><span style="font-style:italic;">Capote</span></a>. It was quite a good movie. Though going to a matin√©e leaves you with much more time than one usually has at night. Oh well. I think there will be video games.</p>
<p>This morning, I had some boring classes, but the third ended up being amusing. The prof seems kind of nervous still and the things he says are often quite amusing. I then went to the mall to get more contact lenses and to not find anything new at Roots.</p>
