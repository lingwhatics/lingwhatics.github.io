<p>This week has been filled with work and hanging out with Heather. Work has been not too bad. And Heather and I have done a bunch of fun things. Overall, it has been great.</p>
<p>I get to start a new semester on Monday and it should be interesting. I am once again pursuing 6 courses simultaneously and that should be a thrill along with my job. In fact, this coming week I will be working five shifts because one of the guys isn't back from vacation yet. I'm sure it will be fine since it is the first week.</p>
<p>For anybody that cares, I am taking some fun classes. Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Mechanics of Solids, Numerical Methods, Technical Communication and Engineering Design. I am not sure if I know anybody in five of those but the last one I'm sure is my whole civil class from last semester.</p>
<p>It should be a good time. I should get to bed.</p>
