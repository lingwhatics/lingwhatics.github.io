<p>Tonight (or last night,for Meghan) I went to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388139/"><span style="font-style:italic;">It's all Gone Pete Tong</span></a>. It was quite funny and the music was pretty cool. It's worth going down to the Uptown to catch.</p>
<p>I think I shall get to bed since I have to get up and mow the lawn tomorrow. Whoever had the great idea of inventing the lawn mower or any lawn cutting implement should be shot, why can't it just grow.</p>
