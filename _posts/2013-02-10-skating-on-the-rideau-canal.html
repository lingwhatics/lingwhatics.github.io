<p>I went skating on the Rideau Canal for the first time yesterday. It was a great afternoon of skating in nice weather.  I stayed longer than I thought I would (3 hours) and skated further (20+ km) than I thought. I did not have a Beaver Tail, so I suppose it was not the most stereotypical Canadian experience. Dow’s Lake is about a 40 minute walk from my house, so I just walked home afterward and picked up a delicious dinner at the Hintonburger.</p>
