Quick errand ride to Bulk Barn. I ran out of tapioca starch (polvilho) and couldn't make p√£o de queijo.

Total trip distance: 9.48 km

Moving time: 0h 35m

Zoomed in image. I found a new route under the 15 on rue Angers, which I think was closed on earlier rides or it never occurred to me that there was another access point.
