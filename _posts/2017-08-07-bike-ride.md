Yesterday, the not too hot weather made me take a ride out to the airport administration building (SE corner of the airport). I took the shortest bike path route to get there and that was 19.1 km.  Then I took a longer route along Eglinton and through the Cedarvale Ravine to get home, which was 19.7 km. The bike path along Eglinton from Scarlett Road westward was really nice and not very busy. My only complaint is the uneven curb ramps at the intersections.

Total trip distance: 38.8 km.
