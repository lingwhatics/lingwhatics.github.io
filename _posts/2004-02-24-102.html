<p>I have noticed that I don't really post as frequently anymore, but I guess it just isn't what I want to be doing.  Perhaps I have found better things to do than talk about life... No, I only have found a few better things.  Mostly it has been my English essay that has been distracting me.</p>
<p>It isn't so much that I started it late, but that I didn't have all my ideas even worked out before I started trying to organize them. So, I have ended up stumbling over ideas.</p>
<p>Tonight was ok. Except that I didn't really get much good essay writing done until after 11... I did find quotes before that but some of them I still haven't devised a way to incorporate them.</p>
