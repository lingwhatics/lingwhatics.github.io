<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	I was sitting at my computer and the sun glared in my eyes again, but this time it was all red and sinking fast. So naturally, I got the camera and took its photo. It was setting much faster than I thought and didn't get as many shots as I hoped for. Maybe tomorrow.</p>
<p>Also, my Apple router seems to have died all it does is have the ethernet port lights on and no front light. I'm taking it to BeamEcho tomorrow for either some service or Apple to replace it.</p>
