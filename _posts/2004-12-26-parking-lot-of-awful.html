<p>This afternoon my mum and I got in the car to go to the mall not to shop but to pick up my sister from work. She finished at the perfectly awful time of 3, when most people seemed to be driving around the parking lot looking for a place to park. So, we foolishly went into the parking lot and after about 30 seconds of entering the lot we decided that we should have just gone and parked across the street, and so proceeded to try that. It took about 10 minutes to get through the parking lot to the other side where we could get to across the street. Most of this time we were hindered by single lane (for two directions) passages and so many idiots driving their SUVs or vans with only one occupant, I'm sure some of them were driving to the doors to pick up their companions but most of them were just idiots wasting gas and space.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I completed my Consumer Day shopping on Christmas Day at 1 A.M. at the beginning of the online Consumer Day sales.<br /></p>
