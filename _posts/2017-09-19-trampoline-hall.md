Last night, a colleague and I went to see [Trampoline Hall](http://www.trampolinehall.net "Trampoline Hall") (both for the first time). It was a really fun show and I learned some things about Indigenous Humour, the Literal Void and why good ideas don't get implemented.

My favourite lecture of the evening was Audrey Dwyer speaking about the Literal Void. This was the lecture title that meant the least to me going into the evening, but it resonated the most. Her descriptions of the void, all the aspects of void-ness and the ways of seeing voids all around were wonderful. The questions generated and Audrey's answers were also great.

Max FineDay talking about Resilience and Indigenous Humour was enlightening and a reminder of the history that is around us related to our relationship with indigenous groups over time. He spoke about his first memory of racism and how humour is a coping mechanism to keep going.

Lewis Poplak spoke about why good ideas don't get implements and specifically a case study of commuting to work on bicycle. He taught me that the first "bike" (more a balance bike style) was invented 200 years ago.

If you are in Toronto the night that Trampoline Hall is happening, I would recommend that you find yourself in the audience and you will certainly learn something. If you don't think you'll learn something at very least you will get to laugh, but I'm pretty sure even you will learn something.
