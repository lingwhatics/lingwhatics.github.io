Yesterday, I finished reading [_The Mirage Factory_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37542208-the-mirage-factory "Link to The Mirage Factory on Goodreads.") and it was a great trip through three parts of the early 1900s development of Los Angeles. It takes you through the triumphs of William Mulholland securing water for the city, the upward trajectory of the movie industry and the rise of evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson (Canadian connection alert!!). Of course, none of these three continue their success forever. The stories together make for a nice peek at the development of LA from a middle of nowhere to a city on the path to greatness. It was a nice reminder of all the areas I still need to visit next time I get out to LA.
