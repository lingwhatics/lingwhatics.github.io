<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	Sunday, we had a walk in the Annex and passed some lovely old houses. There was one 3 apartment house on sale but I imagine it was really expensive and can't even check because MLS decided that the great site Housing123.com infringed on their trademarks and copyrights and instead of buying the great site that used the googlemaps  API, they had it shut down. You can really trust "Realtors". Bunch of wankers.</p>
<p>Anyway, this was a neat path to somebody's front door.</p>
