Yesterday, I went for a test ride of the new bike I am buying (a Yuba Kombi). I took a ride from the bike shop around Villeray on a bunch of streets I have only ever walked before. The bike was lovely and I'm excited to get it all kitted out and ready to take the baby around the city in a week or two.

Total trip distance: 3.27 km

Moving time: 0h 16m
