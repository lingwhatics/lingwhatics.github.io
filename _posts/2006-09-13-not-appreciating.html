<p>I found <a href="http://lingwhatics.blogspot.com/2004/12/our-land-shouldnt-it-have-our-tv.html">this post</a> tonight while skimming through my old posts. It seems that it is just as applicable now as when I wrote it originally. It could be applied to <span style="font-style:italic;">Bon Cop, Bad Cop</span> or any number of Canadian movies that receive "bad" reviews before reviewers have even seen them because they were made here by people from here. This is really unfair because I thought it was a really funny movie.</p>
<p>I know I live in Calgary and speaking French here seems to be something you only do if you want to offend people around you, but the movie was really funny. I think it might have been even more amusing because I didn't have to read the subtitles because I can understand both the languages of the film. Anyway, the old post is a good one.</p>
