<p>I haven't a clue why I am posting now because I don't really have much to say.  Maybe I should tell a story, but I am no story teller.  I stick to the facts and don't feel the need to explain them. This approach causes me problems in university. One day I will find a subject that I ultimately care about and I will then explain what I say with concrete evidence. Though maybe it would be good for me to pursue something where I can just make things up. </p>
<p>Description is just not in my cards. May those are the ones missing from my deck. I guess I will figure it out.  I should really draw more, work with spatial relations.</p>
