A morning to go to the playground on the way up Park and then to March√© Jean-Talon. We had a delicious (as always) lunch at Patati Patata on Jean-Talon before heading home. On the way home, we stopped on Ste-Catherine to listen to Oktopus (a klezmer band) and the baby danced up a storm.


Total trip distance: 17.65 km

Moving time: 1h20
