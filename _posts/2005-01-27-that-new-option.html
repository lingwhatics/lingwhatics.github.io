<p>I was sure that the US could think up a worse option for losing more lives in Iraq but apparently there are some who have. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4209595.stm">This article</a> on BBC about the 'Salvador Option' seems to show such a plan, where a life would become about as valuable as a bullet.<br /></p>
