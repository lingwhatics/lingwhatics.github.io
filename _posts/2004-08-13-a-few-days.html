<p>The last few days have been pretty good. I actually had a full day of work yesterday, which was a nice change from the rest of the week when i only worked for half to 3/4 shifts. I managed to say I would work on Saturday from 7am until like 3, but that's ok because the money wil be good at the end of the summer or later in the school year. I also start at 9am for the next week and that time has a much better finishing time.</p>
<p>Speaking of finishing, I am now done painting my aunt's house which is nice since that project took longer than I was hoping that it would. Work just got in the way of that project, but work also paid me more money over the summer so yea.</p>
<p>Last night I went over to Rhoda's and a table was tiled it was an interesting process, though somewhat less messy than I envisioned it being. Later most of us went to Jamie's to watch <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325710/"><span style="font-style:italic;">The Last Samurai</span></a>, well most of it. We didn't finish it because <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Show</span> was on and it's a must watch at least the nights it is on <a href="https://www.ctv.ca">CTV</a>.</p>
<p>That's about all for now, but I'm sure I will think of something later.</p>
