<p>I took this one on Saturday after we had left the St. Lawrence Market. Sunday, we went down to my aunt and uncle's house in Villanova. Then today, we went on an adventure. We got off the subway at Pape and walked down Danforth then through a park to Riverdale Farm. (Pictures of that will probably be posted tomorrow evening.) Eventually, we walked to Yonge along Bloor and caught the subway back up.</p>
