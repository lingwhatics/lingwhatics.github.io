<blockquote>Mass production is characterized by the fabricating of separate units which are then put together in special workshops. Propaganda and totalitarian politics, such as terrorism and repression, employ the same system. Propaganda spreads incomplete truths, in series and as separate units. Later these fragments are organized and converted into political theories, which become absolute truths for the masses. </p></blockquote>
<p>Â– Octavio Paz, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sons of La Malinche</span> (Page 68)<br /></p>
