## Where am I?

Montr√©al, QC

## What am I doing?

- Enjoying the last couple days of my parental leave (19 weeks). The baby and I went on walks every day and had great weather almost every day. (paid leave is an amazing thing and worth fighting for).
- French: reading, listening and watching. Also Spanish on duolingo to for now keep a step ahead of the baby.
- I got my second dose of the Covid vaccine 2 months ago (on the original schedule I would have gotten it only 2 weeks ago.)

## What's Next?

- Return to work on Monday (September 13)
- Learning to paint (I received watercolours and a large how to paint book for Christmas 2019).
- Looking forward to my sisters visiting near the end of October.

Idea for this came from [Peter](https://ruk.ca/content/what-am-i-doing-now "What am I doing /now").
