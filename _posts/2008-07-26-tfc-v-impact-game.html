<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	Tuesday night was the final game in the Canadian Championship (Soccer). It was between Toronto FC and Montreal Impact. The game ended in a tie and therefore Montreal were the champions. Unfortunately, Toronto didn't really play past the first half hour. They spent a lot of time passing the ball in Montreal's end, but none of the players seemed to take responsibility for shooting on net.</p>
