Today's ride was another beer run, but this time out to Bellwoods. It was raining and I foolishly didn't put on my rain pants so I returned home with soaked jeans. I also stopped by P.G. Clucks for my first amazing fried chicken sandwich and I will be back there for sure.

Total trip distance: 13.8 km
