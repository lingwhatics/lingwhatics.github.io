<p>Today has been interesting so far. I went to the Optometrist and found that I get to keep using the same contacts until I run out, then will have to get the same for one eye and different for the other. It's too bad because I have always managed to keep both eyes the same contact prescription... Now I will actually have to grab a lens from a different box when I change them every month or so.</p>
<p>After that I went and picked up Jamie and Meghan and we returned to the mall. I contemplated buying this nice pair of <span style="font-style:italic;">North Face</span> shoes but I just got new shoes on Boxing Day, incidentally at the same store that I was going to get the new ones.</p>
<p>Oh they have these awful ads... Maybe they are just stupid but whatever... In the mall, they say something like "Women love shopping at the new Market Mall" and they have a bunch of different pictures. One with a bunch of sleeping bags each in a parking spot, each with a woman inside presumably waiting to get into the mall. There is another which is a wedding cake with just the little groom figure on top and still another with a guy laying on a blanket as if he were leaning over to kiss his sweetie but she's gone, who knows where but I bet it wasn't the new mall. Anyway, the things are stupid, but the mall is much nicer than it used to be.</p>
<p>There is an <span style="font-style:italic;">EB</span> in the new section of the mall, which was kinda cool. We also went to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Play</span> store and there I was listening to the amazing CD in the world music section. But I didn't buy it since I didn't feel like it I guess.</p>
<p>Where else did we go... Oh right <span style="font-style:italic;">Coles</span> I was going to buy this book about punctuation but then I didn't feel like it. I guess I didn't want to spend much money today.</p>
<p>Video games are up for tonight, which should be fun since I haven't done that in a while... Actually on second thought we played some N64 the other night... Oh well.</p>
<p>That's all for now.</p>
