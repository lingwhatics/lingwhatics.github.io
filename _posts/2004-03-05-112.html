<p>I don't have much to report from today. I went to school and that's about it. I didn't really do anything exciting. Oh well I got my Neuro quiz back and I got 19/20 so that was good. I haven't done that well since the first one.</p>
<p>I have been trying to choose what topics to do for my papers, and that is progressing sort of ok.</p>
<p>This is a pointless post. Perhaps I just won't post until I can think of something good. Wait... I had thought of something good but I can't find it. I wrote it on a random piece of paper that was on my desk so chances are that paper is somewhere in my room now.</p>
