<p>Work is going well. I have completed about half the models that I think I need to do before Monday. I really need to talk to my supervisor to clear up that my results are telling me what I think they are.</p>
<p>It was just raining out the front window of my house and it was raining hard, but of course it was very sunny out there. It looked almost as if there were no clouds about where the rain was coming from.</p>
