<p>So I have been trying since I got home to read about all the aphasias I am supposed to know about, and as of yet have not accomplished that. Not that I haven't been doing anything productive.</p>
<p>I guess I will just say that one day I will do what I want to do and on that day I will also know what it is I want to do.</p>
