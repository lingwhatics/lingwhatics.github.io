<p>I don't understand this working thing... I do my work before the last couple days then I end up with all this extra time. Doesn't make much sense.</p>
<p>Anyway, I went to a basketball game tonight and U of A lost to U of C. It was kinda disappointing, but it is out of my control. </p>
<p>I guess I don't really have anything to say tonight. Nothing good happened, not to say that something bad did happen. I guess I was just kinda put off that it was cold and nobody wanted to go outside except me. I didn't let that stop me though I went out anyway.</p>
