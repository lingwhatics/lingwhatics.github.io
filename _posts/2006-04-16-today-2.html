<p>Today I bought a pizza, saw Saddam Hussein buying coffee at The Roasterie and watched a rockin' video which you should all see. <a href="https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6053863688509045791&amp;q=calgary&amp;pr=goog-sl">Click here for the Flames "Red Hot" video</a>. Alright, it's a little uncertain whether it was in fact Saddam but it was definitely a good video and you should watch the whole thing because I did and Heather did too.</p>
