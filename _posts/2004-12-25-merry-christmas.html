<p>I don't have much to write. I went for a Christmas Eve dinner tonight and it was very good, and we were all very full afterward.</p>
<p>Today, I moved to the next room over in my house so that I could have a place for everything and thus everything could go in its place. It's nice so far though I do miss having two windows even if one always had the curtains drawn. Sometimes they weren't drawn very well but I'm not that great of an artist. Perhaps in my Boxing Day adventures I will find a nice digital camera then I will take pictures for all of you to see.</p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">Merry Christmas</span> to all and have a <span style="color:rgb(51,204,0);">happy holidays</span> if I don't talk to you.<br /></p>
