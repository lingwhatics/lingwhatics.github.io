<p>Well... this is my first Sunday off since I started working at Julio's and it's alright. I liked being able to stay out late last night and have fun then being able to sleep this morning even though I didn't sleep much later than 9.30. Tomorrow I start working from 11.30am until 7.30 (ideally), which will be  a change because my first job will be to work line for the lunch rush. Umm... I don't really know what else to say about that.</p>
<p>Last night I went over to Melissa's with Rhoda and we played a game of Trivial Pursuit. It was quite fun. I had a bunch of things that I wanted to write about over the week and I really have just forgotten what they were. I guess I will remember them later.</p>
