<p>I have worked for two days so far this week and only have 5 more, and then Heather gets here on the day after that. Today at work I was supposed to make food at lunch but I decided that somebody who would be there longer should be able to take my place on the line once I was gone, so I trained somebody on flat top and such, then I went for my lunch break which I was planning on going on when I was told that I was needed on the line. One of the prep cooks came back to work today which was nice because that means that I don't have to do a list on my own all week.</p>
<p>Last night I went over to Jamie's and we played <span style="font-style:italic;">Simpsons Road Rage</span> for PS2 and it wasn't a great game. I was quite tired last night so I went home early, but then didn't get into bed that early.</p>
<p>I'm still tired so I think I will be off to bed even though it is just 7.30.</p>
<p>Song:  Seize the Day from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104990/"><span style="font-style:italic;">Newsies</span></a> and Austin - Blake Shelton<br />
<br />Book: How the Scots Invented the Modern World (I don't know if I will finish it, it's long and I don't have much time in the day that I devote to doing nothing so reading can't be fit in... Or maybe I will finish it)<br /></p>
