We biked a lot this summer so took transit much less. The tradition of reporting since 2014 continues. I counted "unofficial" transfers on the STM as two rides. I took 62 rides in 2023. My rides were paid for using: Presto (3), OPUS (41), and Oyster (18).

|REM        |OPUS       |           2|       0.00|

I hardly had any work transit rides in 2023. We took a trip to London in March, I was in Toronto in May, and we had a weekend in Ottawa. We also took a ride on the REM during the preview weekend at the end of July.

## Year over year
Weekday riding stayed low, except in March when we were in London.

Coming out of the pandemic slowly increased my transit use, but biking on my new cargo bike picked up more of the further away trips.
