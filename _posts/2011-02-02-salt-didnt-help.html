<p>In an update on yesterday's story, the salt didn't help. That sidewalk was just a snow-covered as the next. It had even more snow than the one following it because the proprietor of the next one did something truly revolutionary for Toronto... they used a shovel to clear the snow away. It made me feel like I was in Calgary where people regularly shovel their sidewalk.</p>
<p>The giant snowfall did not materialize downtown. I had a nice walk to school. It was much quieter than usual because so many people decided not to take their cars. Here's an excellent take on what we should call the rest of this snow storm day.</p>
