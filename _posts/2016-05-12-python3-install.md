Last night, I spent a bunch of time using [homebrew](https://brew.sh "homebrew") to install python3 along with the SciPy stack. The endeavour was relatively successful as the components appear to work. Numpy tests fine, but scipy and matplotlib have a bit more difficulty.

I decided to try python again because it seems that it is the prevailing language for the engineering analysis coding in my office. I am still working at getting my colleagues to use R for our team tasks, but that is slow going. Working with other teams has, at least it appears to have, pulled us out of using Excel macros/VBA. This is a positive development since I have always found following the changes in their code.

The company has an internal GitLab instance, so it will be possible, with some optimism and cajoling, to get a clearer understanding of what has changed in the code and why it has been changed. Maybe we can even setup an issues-based to do list.

We shall see.
