Leisurely Sunday ride to Verdun, along Monk and back along the Lachine Canal. Late enough in the morning to avoid the hard core cyclists and early enough to mostly avoid the families and picnicers. Beautiful day out there with plenty of people enjoying their space along the canal.

Total trip distance: 13.01 km

Moving time: 0h 46m
