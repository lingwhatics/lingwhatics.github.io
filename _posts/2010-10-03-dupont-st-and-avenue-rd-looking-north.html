<p class="flickr-yourcomment">So different now.</p>
<p><em>Update </em>(16 November 2011)</p>
<p>I finally figured out where all these buildings went. Now if you were at this intersection, you wouldn't find any of these buildings and it is because this was to be part of the Toronto highway system. The <a title="Wikipedia of Torontoâ€™s Cancelled Expressways - Crosstown Expressway" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancelled_expressways_in_Toronto#Crosstown_Expressway" target="_blank">Crosstown Expressway</a> was going to pass through here heading east to the Don Valley Parkway. The City or Metro would have purchased the land, which explains why all the land under the buildings in the photo is now park.</p>
