<p>This is one of Heather's many photos from our day trip, since I was driving and can't take photos while doing that. I think it is a really cool shot.</p>
<p>What else... oh we met up with Anne and Trevor and co at Union last night to get some eats before they all caught the train to Kingston. I'm sure we will see Anne again soon, if not Trevor too.</p>
<p>Fun times and now I should get in bed at least try to go to sleep.</p>
