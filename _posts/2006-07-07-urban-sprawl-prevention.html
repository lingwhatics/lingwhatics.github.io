<p>I was reading a bit about conservation at the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority. I was actually looking for something about a test parking lot using interlocking pavement, but think the source was not correct and I couldn't find it. I did, however, find <a href="http://www.trca.on.ca/latestnews/?articleID=1056">this article</a> about containing urban sprawl and it reminded me that I wanted to post my report I wrote for my COMS class.</p>
<p>A PDF version of the paper is available <a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/%7Edtmikals/363paper.pdf">here</a> (16MB). Feel free to give me  your comments.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Note: I got an A+ in that class</span></p>
