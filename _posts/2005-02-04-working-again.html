<p>I started working at the lab on Tuesday and so far it has been fun. We are moving to a new building, and the whole process is kind of disorganised but we are done about 1/3 of the lab moving now. We have to set it all back up and move more tomorrow. I think they want to be in the new lab and be up and running completely by about Monday, but we don't really know when the grinder and big oven will be moved so part of the operation might be at the old lab for a while.</p>
<p>There are 5 new people at the lab that weren't there when I worked there last but apparently many people have worked there in the interim, 4 years is quite a while. Only one of them is sort of annoying but he annoys some of the others too, so I don't let it bug me too much. Also, I haven't had to see him much since the first day because he has been working at the new lab while I have been at the old one.</p>
<p>I had my first Engg Econ quiz yesterday, and it wasn't that hard. I sat outside the class and read my book for a while after because I had just spent 35 minutes on the bus and left work early for a 10 minute long quiz. Oh well, that is all part of going to school whilst working.</p>
<p>Speaking of the bus ride, it is much shorter and better than I thought it would be. To get to work takes about 15 bus minutes and 8 walking, to the old lab. I think like 18/5 to the new one. I will have finished a book in 4 days on the bus. I guess I will have to go to the library more so that I can keep reading on the bus. The bus is not very busy at 7.32 when I catch it, which is nice since I don't really care for busy busses since I end up standing and not getting to read. Anyway, I will get to bed since I have to get up in the morning for work.</p>
