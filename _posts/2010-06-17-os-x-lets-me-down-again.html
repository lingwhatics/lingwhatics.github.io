<p>Went to install 10.6.4 release and it gave me a javascript error. So search around for a solution and it seemed that something else had installed incorrectly. Not a clue what... After repairing my hard drive since it seems to lose a file whenever I boot into Windows 7, OS X wouldn't start anymore and I had to reinstall it. BOOOOO!</p>
