I didn't really plan the ride today. I just went with the turns and found myself crossing the Jacques-Cartier bridge so I decided to cut it off at the island and come back past Habitat '67. It was really windy on the westward parts of the ride.

Total trip distance: 14.80 km

Moving time: 0h 48m

Today's ride:
