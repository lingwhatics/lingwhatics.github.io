<p>Last night was when they announced who won <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/greatest/">the Greatest Canadian</a> contest, and just as I had hoped <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/greatest/top_ten/nominee/douglas-tommy.html">Tommy C. Douglas</a> won. Even though one could vote multiple times, I only voted for him once and that was after the first time I saw his segment. Anyway that was something good that happened yesterday.</p>
<p>I also watched Citizen Kane because Lise-Ann had to watch it for her Film class. It was pretty good though I thought it dragged a bit near the end. I finished reading <span style="font-style:italic;">A Short History of Nearly Everything</span> by Bill Bryson. It was pretty good overall, but I got less interested once the book started with the biology part.</p>
<p>Song: Walk of Life - Dire Straights, Guerilla Radio - Rage Against the Machine<br />
<br />Book: Nothing right now, maybe nothing until I get to Calgary<br /></p>
