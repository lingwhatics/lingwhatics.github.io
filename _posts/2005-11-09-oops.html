<p>Just got home from wings. They were good. I met up with Batoul and a bunch of her engineering friends. It was nice talking to engineering students who weren't out of their minds and in love with using roadmaps for assignments labs.</p>
<p>I forgot about this post after I started talking to Heather. I will have to write a better post tomorrow.</p>
