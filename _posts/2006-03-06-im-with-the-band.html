<p>I talked to some guy in the band Hedley while asking him to move his vehicle because it was in my fire lane. He told me he was so and so from the band ( I really don't remember who because it didn't really care who he was) and I thought to myself, "I don't care who you are I just want you to move your vehicle". He said he would move it to the other side of a van that was nearby and that was good enough for me.</p>
<p>I find it amazing how people love bands so much that they know all the people's names and such. I know the names of a few people in random bands but most of them I wouldn't know if I saw them on the street. Unless of course there was a huge crowd around them.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
