<p>Although I know that people read this I guess that doesn't matter. I can't express what I want to say, but that is usually the way things go. It happens to me on work too. I can't say what I want to say. I am not capable of expressing myself, and this is really aggravating.<br />
<br />Even while saying this I can't say it the way I want to. </p>
<p>I need to do something about my hair. I'm sure this will be nice to hear for some of you, but I don't think I will cut it that much. Maybe just a trim. Then I can dye it some random colour. Perhaps not the colour part.</p>
<p>Oh! The brain... yea didn't learn anything about that. At least I didn't remember much once I got to my quiz.</p>
<p>Song: A medley of Newsies, Brown Derbies and Random other stuff<br />
<br />State: Good but unexpressive</p>
