<p>I don't really like <span style="font-style:italic;">The O.C. </span>anymore. Well I haven't for a while because it is just getting too predictable. It isn't quite like a soap because they actually have things that are so unrealistic and unbelievable that you can't guess they are coming, not that I think such things should be added.</p>
