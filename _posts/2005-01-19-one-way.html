<p>Apparently I can take the class I wanted to take even though I don't have the transcripts that I need and am still waiting for consent to take the class. I would really like to take at least one class this semester so that I feel more like I will be going to school in the fall, but if that doesn't happen then it won't be horrible.</p>
<p>Also, I might be working at Access Analytical Labs where I worked the summer after high school, but I'm not sure about that. I think I will try to find a part-time job somewhere just to pass the rest of my time. I haven't really done anything all week partly because I didn't feel like seeing anybody, but also whenever I actually talk to people they are busy and want me to call them when I am free, which is always. However, they go to school or work and are more busy, but oh well. Things will work out.</p>
<p>I went to Julio's today and talked to the kitchen manager. It seems that there are only about 5 people who I worked with who are still there. Most of them have changed shifts. Even the assistant kitchen manager went back to Edmonton. Oh well, I don't think that I will be working there but it might happen if the lab falls through, which it won't!.</p>
<p>The people I had tried to call yesterday couldn't help me today which was very annoying but I was happy to talk to Access. Especially after I heard that they moved to a bigger space.</p>
<p>I guess that is all for now.</p>
