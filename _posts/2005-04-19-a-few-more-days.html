<p>In two nights I have my final exam for Engg Econ and last night I wasn't nearly worried enough to do anything about it. I ended up going over the Melissa's hot tub. I spent the earlier part of my night playing solitaire and talking with Heather.</p>
<p>Today at work, I folded filter paper for 4.5 hours. It was just so thrilling I can hardly contain my enjoyment of the whole affair. Anyway, I left there early so that I could start studying here. That didn't really happen until I had had a snack and such but it did start faster than if I had stayed at work until 4 and then got home at 5-ish. I found some quizzes on EDIC that were different than ones I had done so I did those, so I knew what is going down in that class. I have a few more questions that I plan to do tomorrow and I think I will have to put a few more formulas in my calculator tomorrow. But I'm sure that as soon as I program them, I will remember them and never forget them. This always seems to happen to me. In Engg 201 (Behaviours of Gases, Liquids and Solids), we were allowed to use our textbook on exams and quizzes, but I only ever used it for the newest formulas or values form tables because I knew all the rest of the formulas. If called upon I might even be able to rattle off a few of the formulas and maybe a constant or two.</p>
<p>I got an e-mail from the Engineering Office today telling me that I should submit my program choices, which I did 2 weeks ago. It also told me that any student with 8 or more first year technical courses was eligible for second year placement and that was great news because I have 9 that are still first year courses and 2 that are second year plus Engg Econ. I am coming closer and closer by the day to the day when I look at Infonet and it will say your application has been accepted, or worse cases scenario that my second program choice has been accepted (but I know it would be if it came to that because I have been guaranteed that by an advisor, barring any problems from my side.) After getting the e-mail I did check to make sure that I had submitted my program request and hadn't simply chosen it and not hit 'submit'. I had sent it so it's all good.</p>
<p>I should get to bed as I slept for like 5 hours last night and I dunno how two nights of such an activity would work considering the tiny amount of work I need to do tomorrow at work.</p>
