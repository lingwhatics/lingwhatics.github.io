## Move update

It is going well. There are only a few boxes of odds and ends left along with wardrobe boxes, which will stay until the closet gets some rods. We even emptied our decluttering/staging storage locker so we don't need to keep paying for that. Just one storage locker to move with sports equipment and I can't forget to get my bike from the other bike room.
