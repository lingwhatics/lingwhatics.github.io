<p>It seems that I enjoy buying books.  I went to Chapters today and I bought three more books.  I guess this is what I am doing with my Christmas money. There are worse things that I could spend it on so this isn't too bad. </p>
<p>Walking today was much nicer than yesterday though today the streets were a very dark brown colour and something that was once snow flew at you as cars passed. It was about the same temperature as yesterday too.  Quite mild compared to how it has been recently.</p>
<p>I made these excellent chocolate waffles yesterday, and have decided that Saturday will be waffle day. </p>
