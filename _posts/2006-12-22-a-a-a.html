<p>So it appears that I got an A- in Geology. The grade isn't there but if she keeps here ranges that she posted earlier in the semester then I will.</p>
<p>I worked today and it wasn't not that exciting. Almost all the cars on campus were pass holders, which was alright made it easier not to give out too many pre-Christmas tickets.</p>
<p>I don't know what else. If anybody it in town, gimme a call and we can do whatever.</p>
