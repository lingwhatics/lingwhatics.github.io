<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	Took this while I walked home from the bus yesterday. It was a pretty good day at work. Of course, I was at work and got nothing done on the studying front. However, in the evening I did do quite a bit of geology.</p>
<p>Today was cold and so I didn't go outside. I did manage to study most of the day, so that is good.</p>
