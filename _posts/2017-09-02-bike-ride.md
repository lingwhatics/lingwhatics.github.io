Today's ride was really two rides. The morning ride took me through Rosedale and Cabbagetown. After a pit stop for lunch at home, I went down to see the airshow then continued along the waterfront until Kipling. Then I went up to the subway, took the train shortcut back toward home.

Total trip distance: 42.6 km.
