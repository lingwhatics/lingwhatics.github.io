<p>An interesting story response to a story that makes me sort of happy that I'm not paying Rogers for internet but Bell isn't much better.</p>
<p>Perhaps the CRTC should let them raise rates again but require that all local stations be broadcast in HD by the US deadline (2009) and that if they do not provide better HD over-the-air than on cable they lose their license. The stations aren't paying that much for the airwaves they can spend a bit on providing high quality content and also high quality signal.</p>
