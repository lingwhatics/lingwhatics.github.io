<p>Today has been for the most part a productive day, at least so far it has. I have been reading and organizing my neuro notes. I want to get a good grade on my quiz tomorrow.</p>
<p>I found that I have a new Morphology assignment, and it's great because it is about Swahili. I know enough about Swahili that I should do well on it. If I don't I will be embarrassed.</p>
<p>Yea, so I had a fun weekend which was full of me doing very little and it was great.</p>
<p>Song: Jets Song from <em>West Side Story</em><br />
<br />State: Good, I seem more organized today</p>
