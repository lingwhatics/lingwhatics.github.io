<p>Alright so I was talking to Meghan and she's funny this is what she wrote:<br />
<br />Thank you very much, oi oi oi. says: (4:52:23 PM)<br />
<br />   yeah...i ate a mint and now i don't feel so great</p>
<p>Thank you very much, oi oi oi. says: (4:52:26 PM)<br />
<br />   my dog!</p>
<p>Thank you very much, oi oi oi. says: (4:52:29 PM)<br />
<br />   i must go!</p>
<p>Then she promtly left. It was amusing to say the least.</p>
