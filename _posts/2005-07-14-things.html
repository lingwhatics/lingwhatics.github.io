<p>Nothing much is new. I just thought I should write so that people keep reading this for when things actually are new or I rant about something. Though, it seems these days that I use up my ranting while talking to people in real life.</p>
<p>The Engineering people still haven't let me into school. Though the university let Heather in, which was good to hear. I want to be let in soon. I haven't even ventured to look at the classes that I have to take again. They are probably all mostly full. I will eventually have to make a timetable for the classes that I can scrounge for a linguistics degree. Oh well. I'm sure I will be told about Engineering before I go to T..</p>
