<p>School so far has been quite good. I had my first pop quiz in Latin American Studies and of course almost all the class had not completed their reading, though with my readings that I had done I think I got most of the quiz right. The problem with the readings for that class is that they are really long and boring. One of them was a translation of Cortez's original journal when he went to Mexico for the first time oh way back when. Needless to say his account was kind of dry.</p>
<p>At some point in the next 5 days I have to watch a movie for that class too. I don't really want to go watch it tomorrow night but I don't want to watch it on Friday night or Monday either. I guess I will just have to make a choice.</p>
<p>I think I will look for a job this weekend. Oh and I get to start playing dodgeball this weekend. I should look for when that is scheduled.</p>
<p>I know these posts aren't that compelling but they'll get better.</p>
<p>Song: Wonderboy - Tenacious D<br />
<br />Book: Same as below (It's going slow since I only really read it for a few minutes before class)<br /></p>
