<p class="flickr-yourcomment">Heather and I went to see Go! once again today, at CBC. You can listen to it on <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/go/">their website</a> (just click on Audio on the left column). It was an amazing show. We have been about 6 times now and the audience was very into it. The guests were funny and the musical guest was excellent.</p>
