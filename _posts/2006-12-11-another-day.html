<p>Another day of not studying really. I did read through all my environmental engineering notes. I'm not really sure what that has given to me, but that's all I did school-wise today. I worked most of the rest of the day. It was sort of dead at work today, but that isn't so surprising since it is exam time and most people pay for parking this time of year. Anyway, it was better than last night.</p>
