<p>Just a little update for today.  Today didn't start out well I got to my first class and realized that I was missing my clipboard. I had to use paper from my Spanish notebook.</p>
<p>But it turned out to be a very odd day. Anyway I have actually made an |About Me| section on my other website which is linked to here so yea...</p>
<p>Song: Einstein on the Beach by the Counting Crows<br />
<br />State: Good my first class tomorrow is cancelled. I get to sleep in.</p>
