<p>Alright a new post from me... I stayed up late-ish last night (though it doesn't seem that late it was only like 12.45) watching the hockey game and I was disappointed that it didn't just end there. But I guess the next game will be fun to watch too.</p>
<p>So I was thinking the other day about a way of motivating people to do things... though this idea is only really useful to people you are close to and even then it's not that great... You offer half a kiss... then when they finish the task then they get the other half. But you ask what is a half kiss well I have included some horrible picture of me demonstrating.  First you have the top half:

<p>Now of course that is only half, and the other half is the important element in closing the deal:

<p>Now I know what you are thinking... wow isn't that a dumb idea... well if you think so then fine I don't care but don't come crying to me when it works as motivation.</p>
