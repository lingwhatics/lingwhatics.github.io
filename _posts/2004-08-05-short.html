<p>At post time there are only 24 days left to wait. Also only one more day of work in my 9 day stretch.</p>
<p>Today wasn't a bad day. There was a bit too much holding up the counter but what can you do if there aren't any people ordering.</p>
<p>I found the mobile phone I am going to buy so I think I will go talk to the <a href="http://www.fido.ca/portal/product/handsetdetail.jsp?id=siem_m55&amp;lang=en&amp;cat=1">Fido</a> people about it on Friday or Saturday.</p>
