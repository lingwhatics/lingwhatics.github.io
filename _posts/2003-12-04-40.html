<p>Is it bad if the pile of work doesn't get smaller? Well that's how my pile went today.  I did read the rest of the stuff from my history textbook.  And I wrote three sentences for my syntax paper.  I don't only have 3 written, I have about 6 pages so I'm not too worried I just wanted to get that out of my way today and that doesn't seem to have happened.</p>
<p>I have taken the opposite route of other people and I have had MSN open all day. It didn't really hinder much. On the account that nobody else bothered to come online except Meghan. Oh well.</p>
<p>State: Staring contest with the pile. (I think I'm winning, hard to say)<br />
<br />Music: Let It Be - The Beatles</p>
