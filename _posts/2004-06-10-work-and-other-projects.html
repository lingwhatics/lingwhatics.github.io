<p>So last night after my Spanish midterm I went down to Julio's with Rhoda, Meghan and Jasmine. It was pretty good though we had to wait for about 40 minutes to get in, not because it is so popular (It is really popular though), but because somebody in the kitchen hadn't bothered to show up for work and on top of that the dishwasher walked out. Possibly because he was annoyed with how unhelpful some of the front house people are or because he just didn't think he wanted to wash dishes anymore. I guess it isn't that important why. </p>
<p>When I got to work today I went in the front door which I usually don't do but the Assistant Kitchen manager was sitting there and talked to me for a few minutes and I got longer shifts out of the chat which isn't too bad because since the first day I have only had two 8 hour shifts. So I'm happy about the longer shifts. I think on Friday night I will get overtime because I start at 4 p.m. and last Friday I was there until 1 a.m. so 9 hours woohoo... I hope anyway.</p>
<p>I started a project tonight and finished it, which is the reason that I am posting at 3.30 a.m. Anyway the project was really cool and it will be liked. I should get to bed so I can get up and do stuff tomorrow before class.</p>
