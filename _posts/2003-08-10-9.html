<p>Things are all falling into place again (maybe that should be still).  I moved most of my stuff up to Edmonton today and it was great.  My room here looks kind of bare, but no matter.</p>
<p>I got this super cool desk from Ikea.  That's not really true it is a table top and legs and that's all but i will call it my desk. It's a great red top with black legs my eMac should look super cool sitting on it.</p>
<p>I am too tired to continue writing tonight maybe you'll get more tomorrow</p>
