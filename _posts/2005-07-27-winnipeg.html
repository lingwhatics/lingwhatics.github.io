<p>Jackie once told me that her friend's car broke down in downtown Winnipeg and she got an STD. Actually she told me that more than once, but it never stopped being funny because later she would explain that the two things have nothing to do with each other. Saying it that way just makes the story sound better.</p>
<p>Today, I volunteered at the Solar Car Race. It was a nice day and I had quite a bit of fun. I saw Caitlin, Linds and Anne, and Liz. I also met MP Rob Anders. And tomorrow I go back to the bookstore and work for them, which will be fun I'm sure. It will also have less risk of getting a sunburn.</p>
