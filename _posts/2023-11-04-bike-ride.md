We got out on the bikes today with the baby using her bike blanket (micro fleece inner with a weather proof top layer) that velcros to the frame around her seat. She was toasty warm in the wind. It was a sunny day. We just went to the BaNQ and out for lunch, but still nice to get out on the bike again after more than a month.

Total trip distance: 10.29 km

Moving time: 0h53m
