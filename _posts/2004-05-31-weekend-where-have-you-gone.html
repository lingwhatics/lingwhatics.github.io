<p>I know that so far I haven't had a whole lot to do during the weeks except go to school Tuesday and Thursday nights, but it just seems like I haven't even accomplished anything in the other time that I had. However, today I got stuff done.</p>
<p>I started prep on my aunt's house and I transplanted my bamboo to dirt and my new Ikea plant.</p>

<p>Well tonight I didn't do much. I went over to Jasmine's and the group of us at <i>Scooby Doo</i> cereal and watched TV. </p>
<p>Song: Voltei Amor - Trio Mocoto (That last o should have an accent but it won't convert my accent keystroke properly)<br />
<br />State: I think I don't like this slot anymore and shan't use it anymore.<br />
<br />Book: The list is long</p>
