Sunday morning ride along Wellington through the series of parks along the Saint Lawrence starting at Parc Arthur-Therrien to LaSalle. Then up through the neighbourhood to the Canal de l'Aqueduc and up rue Lapierre to Saint-Patrick. This took me back to the Lachine Canal that I cannot seem to avoid riding along these days. I did go across a closed bridge where they have put in a traffic circle for the multi-use path which should be good for the junction.

Total trip distance: 19.68 km

Moving time: 1h 04m
