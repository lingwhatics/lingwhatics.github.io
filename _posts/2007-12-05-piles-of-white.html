<p>Sunday adventure down Bloor. Upon leaving the PATH system we were greeted with rain and piles of snow. The snow clearing in Toronto reminds me of Edmonton. There are large piles all along blocks that prevent you from easily j-walking and your pants get dirty though from salt instead of sand... I prefer sand at least it is a bit like a beach. (Also, the combined sewer system often presents lovely "smells of Edmonton")</p>
