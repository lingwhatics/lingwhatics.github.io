<p>Had my last midterm of the semester today. It was not too hard. I think I believe that I did it right but I will see when I get it back next week sometime. This might sound late for a midterm (well second midterm)  and really it is, but, to all the easiest, there are 10 whole days of this semester left so there is quite a lot of time left in the semester.</p>
<p>I had a group presentation to do today and it was not too bad either. I can't wait until I can just play some video games, that will be fun.</p>
<p>I think that's all for now.</p>
