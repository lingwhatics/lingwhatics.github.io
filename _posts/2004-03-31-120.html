<p>Blah blah blah... la la la... I am so happy that my English paper is done. Now, this criticism of the Whorfian hypothesis won't be all that enjoyable to write forever... But I think it might be an good topic.</p>
<p>I don't really have more to say right now... Conversation I had...</p>
<p>Person: Where is Nelson?<br />
<br />Me: In BC near Kootney Glacier. (I might have said Kokanee but that's not relevant.)<br />
<br />P: That's a real place? What do they do there?<br />
<br />M: glacier type things...<br />
<br />P: What?<br />
<br />M: You know... Slow movement, melting...</p>
<p>Song: Always See Your Face - Love<br />
<br />State: Ship shape</p>
