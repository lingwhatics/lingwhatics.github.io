<p>Spent the afternoon in Owen Sound today with my sisters. On the way in, we snapped some photos of the now cleared out store location.</p>

<p>As you can see, it is not a great sight. The floors were being dripped on still and there isn't much of a roof. At one point while we were outside something fell from the ceiling.</p>
<p>So the good news is that everybody is still ok. They are figuring out what to do next and I'll write about whatever that is when it happens. With luck, it won't be too long.</p>
