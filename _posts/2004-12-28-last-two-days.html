<p>I spent today with Lisa. It was fun; we went skating and chatted. We were going to see a movie then Rachel called so we went to Bowness and played a game similar to Frisbee golf that she had made up. After that we sat in front of the fireplace and chatted some more. All in all a good day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went downtown and met Jasmine, Meghan and Ela (maybe Ala, I was never really sure) at <a href="http://www.mcnallyrobinson.com/">McNally Robinson</a>. I quite like that bookstore though it isn't all that convenient in my day to day travels. However, Chapters/Indigo aren't on my path either, but I guess they just seem more convenient. Anyway, we eventually went to <a href="http://www.mec.ca/">Mountain Equipment Co-op</a> to get me some new sunglasses and I found some quite nice ones. I decided on getting smoke coloured lenses rather than orange because I decided that I would probable use them in brighter light more often than in dim light, aka at night. Then off to the Falafel King, which was really good. I had a great Beef Shwarma there, much better tasting than the donairs that I always got at Marco's in SUB.</p>
<p>I'm sure I had something useful to say. My digital camera shipped today which is welcome news because I really would like to have it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Oh for those who don't want to go out, I think I will have a New Year's thing at my house, though don't quote me on that because I don't want to have to do something that I don't end up wanting to, if you're interested tell me and maybe we can work it out.</p>
