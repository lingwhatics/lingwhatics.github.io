<p class="flickr-yourcomment">I'm not sure what I'm going to do with myself next semester because I have 4 courses. I haven't had have only had less than 5 once before, my last semester at UofA when I withdrew from the LING thesis prep class. Of course, I know in general what I'm going to do after that, but it is kind of like the tracks at night; you know where you are going and the direction, but have no clue when you will be picked up. I hope I don't have to walk all the way because it is really long.</p>
<p>Ok well, I guess I don't know what is really way down there but I have an idea of what is on the way down there.</p>
