<p>I hear the motorcycles coming<br />
They're coming down the hill<br />
They're waiting for the light to change<br />
I hope it never will</p>
<p>I hear the motorcycles coming<br />
Their mufflers blaring full<br />
The groups are getting larger<br />
In summer they're larger still</p>
<p>I hear the motorcycles coming<br />
They never seem to stop<br />
All day and night to their delight<br />
Up and down the hill they chop.</p>
