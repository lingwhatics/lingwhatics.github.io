<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	It was a hot day yesterday (32 C) and the walking wasn't too bad because of the breeze. Eventually from Queen and Bay I made my way to Kensington Market and then through UofT to Bloor and Yonge.</p>
<p>Later, I had dinner at a yummy Italian place on Baldwin street with Heather and Cas. It was sort of a random choice out of the Cheap Eats book but an excellent choice.</p>
