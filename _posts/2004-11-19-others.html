<p>Thursdays always seem to be more productive days for me. Oddly, I get tons of work done, even when I only have like 2 hours before I start watching Thursday night TV. Today I had well over two hours, but just the same a I got lots of stuff done. I did reading for my LA ST paper on the Mexican elections of 2000, and I read the class readings for that class too.</p>
<p>On that note, I actually contributed to that class yesterday. What I said seemed to be the point that the professor was actually going for because she had accepted 3 previous answers by others and would say "and?". It was quite nice because before this point I didn't really have a sense of how lots of the things we were doing was important. Ok, that's not exactly what I mean. I hadn't really been that interested in what we were talking about. We had started talking about things that have happened in the last 20 years and that interested me because I could have first hand knowledge of the events, outside the confines of the readings. Obviously, that is a different way of looking at the situation but for some subjects that's just how I see it. As I'm sure many of you know, I don't really like talking about things that I don't have, at least, some knowledge of.</p>
<p>Moving along to another thing that got discussed in that class. We were having small group discussions about selected writings of Subcommander Marcos (<a href="https://struggle.ws/mexico/ezln/marcos_se_2_wind.html">1</a>, <a href="https://struggle.ws/mexico/ezln/marcos_storm_oct94.html">2</a>, <a href="https://struggle.ws/mexico/ezln/marcos_zedillo_dec94.html">3</a>), and of course we got off topic because that is what usually happens in small group discussions. One of the girls started ranting about what a waste it was to bury people in cemeteries and that funerals were just a stupid event that causes extra hardship to the grieving, but I kind of zoned out of that part. Then the other guy in my group started talking about how he had read two article (<a href="https://www.gateway.ualberta.ca/view.php?aid=3422">First</a>, <a href="https://www.gateway.ualberta.ca/view.php?aid=3423">Second</a>) in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gateway</span> (the student paper) about the movie <span style="font-style:italic;">The Take</span> and its director, Avi Lewis. His problem with the man was that he was a rich person who doesn't like globalisation.</p>
<p>The difficulty with this view is that nobody who have done something that has made the richer than most or have been born into being richer than most can suggest that the way of life that this has got them isn't good for the "greater good". It's absurd, people who have become well off have every right to say the way they got there or the fact that they are so is bad. It would be like saying to somebody complaining about disparity to a rich person and being told "you don't know how bad it is to be rich, you should count yourself lucky not to be". It's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Anyway, I should go to bed because I was going to half an hour ago, or so.</p>
