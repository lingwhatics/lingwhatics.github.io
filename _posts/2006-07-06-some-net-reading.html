<p>I read some neat articles today. All on the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca" rel="tag">CBC</a> site.
<ul>
<li>One about translation - <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_strauss/20060301.html">here</a></li>
<li>Another about left-handedness - <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_strauss/20060116.html">here</a></li>
<li>And finally a long series on solar power - <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/toronto/features/solar/index.html">here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>They were all pretty good.</p>
