A wet ride today that took us to BanQ to browse the kids section and eat delicious sandwiches that Doris made. 

Going through the old port we took the dirt path that all the cyclists take because the path abruptly ends and you can choose to walk your bike beside the container stores or ride on de la Commune with all the angry people who drove to the old port and have to wait for parking. It was very muddy after the rain, but we were prepared with rain pants and hosed down our bikes when we got home.

Total trip distance: 8.57 km

Moving time: 0h 44m
