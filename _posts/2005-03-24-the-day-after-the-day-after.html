<p>Well last night I got the mark for the multiple choice part of my exam and I did quite well... 55/60. I also found out that assuming I did the calculations right that I got the first and last long answer questions all right. The middle one I know I made a small mistake on but it should drop me too much.</p>
<p>I had a pretty good interview today at the University and hopefully that will pan out with a follow-up interview next week. Before that I had a good 6.5 hours at the lab in which I finished more work than I usually do in that time. I guess I just had a groove of some sort. Not sure what there is to do tomorrow, but that is something to figure out then.</p>
<p>There was something else... Oh yea. I heard this great program on <a href="http://www.cjsw.com/">CJSW</a> today. It was a presentation of <a href="http://www.alternativeradio.org/"><span style="font-style:italic;">Alternative Radio</span></a>. It was a talk given by Lester Brown about his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Plan B</span>, which is about improving the environment. Anyway, I enjoyed his talk thoroughly and put the book on hold at the library.</p>
