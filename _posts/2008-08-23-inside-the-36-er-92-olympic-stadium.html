<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	They told me in the stadium that Barcelona was to host the 1936 Olympics until the Spanish Civil War broke out and that those games went to Berlin. And not until 1992 did they win the games. Amazing, that the stadium remained almost un-changed. Yet it still qualifies for UEFA 5-star status.</p>
<p>Whereas in T. they built a stadium that holds 20 000 fans and wouldn't even qualify for EUFA 1 star status even if it held games for EUFA teams. The "amazing" world-class status that Toronto seeks will never be fulfilled with such "visionary" politicians.</p>
