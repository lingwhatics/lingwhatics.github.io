<p>I don't think anybody is reading this.  So, I guess it doesn't matter what I write.  </p>
<p>Let me get right down to it.  People think that eventually I will  move away to be a rich engineer or a lawyer or something rich like that. So they will tolerate until i happen to disappear and they can lose my number and e-mail in one fell swoop and be done with me.  It's convenient, but what happens if I don't leave? Then there is the problem.  How to solve it?  Well that's easy leave.  Then I can be lost in reverse (i know it makes sense i wrote it).  </p>
<p>Well that's better I suppose I just had to say that.</p>
<p>In other better news, I am going to learn to use the mouse with my left-hand.  Now i'm sure all you reading (or just me doesn't matter which) are wondering why don't you already?   Or maybe why would you?  Being left-handed it might make sense, but many of you may not have noticed.  I'm told people don't notice that kind of thing.  I guess it's odd that I know how many lefties there are in my history class.</p>
