<p>It was a long day. I had to drive my sister to work this morning, then catch the bus to work. Work was pretty good today I did many different things: filing papers, shelving books, helping people. Then I came home and moved the furniture in my room. Actually, I only really moved a shelf out and moved my desk across the room. Then I added my red table to where my desk used to be. I still have to organise my papers, which are somewhat in piles on my floor. I should post pictures on here of what my room looks like, but the pictures aren't in the form that I want them to be yet so that will have to be another day.</p>
<p>It is most definitely bed time, so to another day.</p>
