<p>I was sitting in MacHall earlier wondering why the university wireless wouldn't work, turns out the access points were in the process of crashing/breaking because the network wasn't appearing at all when I got back from the mall.</p>
<p>You know, I don't really like the mall but I seem to go there more often than one might think. Thankfully, I completed a large number of tasks, including getting my new contact lenses (which are more expensive for 6 months than my old ones were for a year), getting my sister's birthday present (only 4 days late) and getting the <span style="font-style:italic;">Corner Gas</span>: Season Two DVDs for $20 (really my original goal in going there).</p>
<p>I'm not sure what it is but I feel like the service gets worse at the mall every time I got there. The cashiers care less and less and they are harder to get help from. This doesn't bode well for the upcoming buy-o-rama season.</p>
<p>Have cords gone away? I have been sitting here for about 30 minutes and I'm still the only person here who is wearing them. The pant of choice is jeans, for sure, but there have also been many pairs of track pants and sweats.</p>
<p>This isn't really the productive afternoon that I was envisioning, but then again my assignment was going to be due tomorrow and now it isn't due until Friday. Well the rough draft which isn't marked. The real final draft is due on Tuesday. Also, I started reading my probability book yesterday, which has made the course make a lot more sense. The prof for that class verges on non-sense when he is writing the notes on the overhead.</p>
<p>I think that is it for now</p>
<p>Song: Such Great Heights - The Postal Service<br />Book: Probability one for my class, but that one doesn't really count</p>
