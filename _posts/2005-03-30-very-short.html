<p>Last weekend was good. Heather came and I guess I haven't written anything on here since before then. We had lots of fun and her blog has a better run-down of what we did than mine will.</p>
<p>That might be all for now. Oh I got 90% on my Engg Econ midterm. I think I'm going to go to bed since I'm tired. I might post tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Song: This Town - Hot Hot Heat<br />Book: <span style="font-style:italic;">Plan B</span> by Lester Brown</p>
