<p>I'm sure there have been things going on. I don't really know what they are but they were probably partially productive and mostly fun.</p>
<p>Last night, Heather, Meghan and I went to Loose Moose. It was quite fun. I had never been to it even though my sisters love it. Later, Jamie joined us and we went for coffee at Higher Ground in Kensington then to watch <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrubs</span> from season 4.</p>
<p>School has been ok recently. I have been working a lot though. I worked the last 4 days. And I will probably work a bit just before the start of November because The Tragically Hip are playing 4 nights in MacHall.</p>
<p>I finally have posted some more photos on flickr. I hadn't really taken my camera anywhere for the last week or so. I'm not really sure why. I must've thought I was too busy to do anything with the photos or maybe it was too cold or rainy.</p>
<p>Song:  Summer Skin - Death Cab for Cutie<br />Book: <span style="font-style:italic;">Fever Pitch</span> - Nick Hornby (I have like 20 pages left and never seem to read them)</p>
