<p class="flickr-yourcomment"> Canada Day was busy. After walking along the waterfront Heather and I went down to a Toronto FC v. Vancouver Whitecaps game. Toronto played terrible and Vancouver deserved to win.</p>
<p>Later in the evening we took a streetcar ride out to Ashbridges Bay to see the city's fireworks. The fireworks were great. It was a slow ride home because of all the traffic and the slow streetcar. I have never been on such a packed streetcar; not even at Exhibition after a soccer game. But I did get some good shots.</p>
