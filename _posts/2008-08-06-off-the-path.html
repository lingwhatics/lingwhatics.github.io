<p class="flickr-yourcomment">Sunday, we went for a walk (though i guess people would call it a hike) in Forks of the Credit Provincial Park and it was mostly nice. The only downside were the mosquitoes that started attacking about halfway through the 8.2km walk.</p>
<p>We started on a trail and saw the waterfalls. After the falls, we continued along a trail and somehow ended up back at the parking lot.</p>
<p>Other than mosquitoes, we only saw a garter snake, a toad and many crickets.</p>
