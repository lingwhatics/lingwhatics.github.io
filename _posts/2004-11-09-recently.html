<p>I don't really want to get into the habit of posting only twice a week. Though last week I really couldn't think of anything that would be better than my election post.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I finished my midterms for this semester, which was a really good feeling. It was especially good because I knew what was going on in economics. Last Friday morning, I had business law and the problem with that course is that the test is sort of judgment based, yet it is multiple choice and basically impossible to dispute the answers. Oh well, I probably did fine. The last one I got 7% above class average.</p>
<p>Moving along, today I got a few more books out for my Latin American Studies project. I am going to write about the importance of the 2000 election in Mexico. It will hopefully be a great topic.</p>
<p>That's really all I have right now.</p>
