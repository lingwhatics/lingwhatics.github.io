The whole family went out for a ride today so it was my first time with the baby in the back seat. It was an alright ride with many walkers on the paths. Only one guy was a jerk who was walking his dog right in the middle of the path and got mad when we wanted to pass them. The new bike is very smooth despite being very solid.
