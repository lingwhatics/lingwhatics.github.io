<p>The girls behind me in Thermodynamics today:</p>
<p>- "Time passes so fast. It's been like a year since that pope guy died."<br />- "Which pope guy?"<br />- "You know."<br />- "Oh! The Pope."<br />- "It's been a year... Wow you are going to be like 20, you'll be old."</p>
<p>I mean good god what planet do these girls live on? How could they be in second year engineering? I really think that you should have to get a double degree if you want to be an engineer. One in engineering and another in Arts or Fine Arts, just so that you are well rounded enough to function in the real world. I guess a minor would be acceptable instead of a another full degree, but clearly something is necessary.</p>
