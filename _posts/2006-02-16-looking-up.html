<p>Most things are looking up at this point. The only thing that really isn't looking up is the temperature, but I'm sure somebody is flying to Calgary from Winnipeg and is causing this temperature shift to the negative.</p>
<p>My second drawing only took me 1.5 hours instead of the 7 I had thought it would take. Short cuts are definitely the way to go in the future. I have a midterm tomorrow morning but it should be ok. If I just look at the questions as if they are a sum of their parts rather than one long question. My programming lab, which is due Friday, is almost done. I just have to do the comprehensive flow chart and that should be finished during my lab tomorrow before I head out into the cold to enforce the university regulations.</p>
<p>I think that is all for now. Oh, I only sort of like my new book. The author is more conservative than I would normally bother with but I like his writing in the <a href="http://globeandmail.com/" rel="tag"><span style="font-style:italic;">Globe and Mail</span></a> so I will give the book a chance and finish it. I don't disagree with everything he says.</p>
