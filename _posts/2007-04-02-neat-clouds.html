<p>This was not from this weekend. Though on Friday I did take a pile of photos which still as of now reside on my camera. Heather and I went to see <span style="font-style:italic;">Radiant City</span>. It was really good. Funny and thinking at the same time.</p>
<p>Now, I must sleep and prepare for a long week that only has 4 days.</p>
