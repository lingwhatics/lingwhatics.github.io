<p>A nice analysis of minority politics in Quebec. It is interesting to see that the parties in Quebec are at least a bit interested in what is best for Quebec, but the parties in Ottawa seem only interested in what is best for their party and not the country. Just in case they didn't get the memo... you are representing your constituents for the better country.</p>
