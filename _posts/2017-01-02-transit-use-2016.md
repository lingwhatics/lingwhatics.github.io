I have kept track of all the times I used transit since 2014. This only includes transit on the TTC, which is most of all my transit use. In 2016, I took 161 rides. These are counted in the way the TTC would charge for rides, so when I have a day pass a "ride" is counted whenever I would need to tap my Presto card or deposit a token. (If only they would have two-hour transfers, and I would use it much more often.) I have used fewer and fewer tokens as the year progressed and Presto readers appeared on more vehicles and at all the subway stations.


```r
ddply(data16, "media", summarise, TotRides = sum(rides), TotCost = sum(cost))
```

```
##                media TotRides TotCost
## 1           Day Pass        6   12.00
## 2  Day Pass (Shared)       65   94.38
## 3               Free        2    0.00
## 4             Presto       64  176.80
## 5 Presto + token (2)       14   40.40
## 6              Token       10   26.10
```
My rides were paid for using: Day Passes (71), Tokens (17), Presto (71), and other (2). The Day Pass rides were generally quite cheap because the passes were used on weekends and shared with Heather.

Unsurprisingly, I used the TTC most on Saturdays when Day Passes can be shared. I walk to/from work every day so only use the TTC when I have to go somewhere outside my acceptable walking distance. I am not sure what acceptable walking distance is as it changes depending on the day/weather/time.

Total rides each month do not tell me much except that I was out a lot in April, and used transit more as the year progressed.

## Year over year
Splitting my day of week out by month for the past three years shows that variation in my transit use.

```r
annual_summary <- data_tot %>%
  group_by(as.factor(years)) %>%
  summarise(Annual_Cost = sum(cost), 
            Annual_Rides = sum(rides), 
            Cost_Per_Ride = round(Annual_Cost / Annual_Rides, 2))
names(annual_summary)[1] = "Year"

annual_summary
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 Ã— 4
##     Year Annual_Cost Annual_Rides Cost_Per_Ride
##   <fctr>       <dbl>        <int>         <dbl>
## 1   2014      379.70          206          1.84
## 2   2015      369.30          175          2.11
## 3   2016      349.68          161          2.17
```

So you can see over the past three years, I have been using the TTC a bit less each year. The average cost per trip is creeping upward, and is above the TTC's [average cost per fare of $2.00](https://stevemunro.ca/2016/03/11/what-is-the-ttc-policy-on-fares/ "What Is The TTC Policy on Fares?").
