<p>So last night was the first Dodgeball game that I played in a long time, and it was really quite fun. Afterward everybody was complaining about how much their arms or legs hurt. Of course, this wasn't from the force with which the balls were thrown, but the amount of physical activity that was done. It being a much larger amount than on a "normal" day.</p>
<p>An amusing story: I was laying in bed the other night and every time I car drove on some road it would look like there was somebody walking past my window. Of course, this isn't possible since I live on the eighth floor and I don't know anybody that tall.</p>
<p>I should get some work done, who knows what though.</p>
