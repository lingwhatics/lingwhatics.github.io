<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	An evening walk down Queen West to Spadina and a streetcar ride to Union station. I saw this sign while waiting at a light on Queens Quay, which the company I work at is doing an environmental assessment for.</p>
<p>Today, Trevor and Anne came up for lunch. We went to Granite Brewery and I would say the food was alright and the beer was excellent. (Fries were not that good at all.) Later in the afternoon, we had dessert with Heather's family. All in all a good weekend and it didn't rain until after we were in today. (Which sort of makes up for having to be at work until 10pm on Friday.)</p>
