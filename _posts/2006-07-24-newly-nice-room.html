<p>I was going to write something about my weekend but I started organizing my shelving unit and thought that was a bit more important since there are books all over my room and stuff that I probably don't need also. However, tomorrow, I will post some photos of my room in its new and excellent state. You can see some of my photos during the painting of it <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/dalmond/sets/72157594206994399/with/194922191/">here</a>.</p>
