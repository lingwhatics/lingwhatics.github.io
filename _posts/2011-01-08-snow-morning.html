<p>Woke up to a winder wonderland today. I knew it was going to snow, but you never really think those large flakes will hang around after hitting the ground.</p>

<p>The visibility is a bit limited, but that's ok since everything is covered in white.</p>

<p>Good day to hang about, though I will go out and enjoy walking in the snow.</p>
