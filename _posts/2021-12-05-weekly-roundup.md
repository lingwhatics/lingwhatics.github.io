This week was quite hectic. I had way too much work at work and we moved into a new condo. Thankfully, the move went as smoothly as could be desired and most of the boxes have been emptied to their new homes. As with all moves, we are now trying to figure out where everything goes so it can be useful.

The baby loves the new place because she can make us walk around with her to all the new rooms. And of course, her grandmother came to visit to help with the move so she loves that too.
