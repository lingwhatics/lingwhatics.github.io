<p>I don't think this will be posted in time to fall under Thursday's date but no matter, it is still another post.</p>
<p>Naturally, I trudged through my sociolinguistics textbook and it wasn't so bad. It read a lot like my notes, but with more examples. Oh well... After my exam I have reading break and that will be great. (except for the part where I have to write my English essay.)</p>
<p>I think I will start a new book tomorrow. Maybe <em>Anil's Ghost</em>, but not sure about that yet.</p>
<p>Song: nothing really... the closing credits of <em>ER</em> just faded away.<br />
<br />State: Tired, but happy I almost have a break.</p>
