<p>It seems to be so hard to get started on my studying. I realize that if I just start doing it then I will get it over with and things will be all good but ya know. Nobody ever wants to start studying.</p>
<p>Today was pretty good. I was surprised in my neurolinguistics class because there wasn't a quiz... Which was good because we have our midterm on Thursday.</p>
<p>Why must so many of the people I meet be from Calgary?  Not that I don't like Calgary. Ok, I don't really like Calgary, and I guess all these people didn't either. Oh well. I will get over this eventually...</p>
<p>I should really do some more work. If I finish my Spanish thing today then I can do more work on neuroling tomorrow night. </p>
