Today's ride was down the re-opened Lower Don path, then along Cherry Street along the lake and back via Queen and Broadview. Something happened to the GPS on my phone during the ride and most of the ride south of Lakeshore Blvd. was not in the file so there are few points until I rode back up to Queen in the Beaches.

Total trip distance: 16 km
