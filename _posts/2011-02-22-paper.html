<p>I am writing a paper for a conference I'm presenting at on Thursday, and it is going quite slowly. There seems to be an idea block preventing me from writing more, or maybe not more but clearly. I hope this will pass so that this paper can be sent to be edited tonight, and tomorrow evening can be for revisions.</p>
<p>In other news, my cracked wrist rest on my MacBook was replaced today. The shop just up Yonge street, <a title="Midtown Digital" href="http://www.midtowndigital.com/" target="_blank">Midtown Digital</a>, provided quick thorough service. Now it is as good as new. Having this repaired reminds me that next time I am getting a metal laptop. Apple does not make plastic ones like they used to. My old iBook is still going strong with no visible cracks.</p>
