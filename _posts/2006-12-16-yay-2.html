<p>I got an A in Project Management. I don't know how. I must've done quite well on the final. It's great. And I also have decided to retract part of my "<a href="http://lingwhatics.blogspot.com/2006/12/blog-post.html">A+</a>" post, but if it was a joke on his part to tell us that it was a bit cruel.</p>
<p>Anyway, that is two A so far.</p>
