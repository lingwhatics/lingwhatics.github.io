<p>Alright, I know I never write anything on this page, but in my defense I don't think anybody reads it either.  Which is mildly amusing, and would mean that I am writing to myself. Hmm...</p>
<p>Anyhow, this past weekend was crazy.  I think I did more last weekend then I have in the past three weeks. </p>
<p>So, Friday afternoon my aunt came by to get me and we picked up my uncle at the airport and proceeded to Calgary. When I got there I talked to people in my house for about an hour before Rhoda came and got me and we visited Melissa at work, then went to the Cheese Cake Caf√©. We met Joe,Meghan, Linds, Jasmine and Jamie there.  Ate some cake and I had a reasonably well made Long Island Ice Tea. After this Melissa joined us for about half an hour, we went over to Rhoda's to watch a movie.  I have no clue what it was called, but am sure that I will rent it at some point in the future and vaguely remember seeing it.  Anyway I got home late and then got up early-ish the next morning.</p>
<p>My dad came by at nine in the morning and we drove down to Lethbridge to attend my cousin's wedding. (Congratulations Bonnie and Dennis.)  It was fun and of course I left that late and slept at my grandmother's house.  </p>
<p>On Sunday another cousin and his wife drove me back to Edmonton.  I went out almost as soon as I got home and hung out with Rachel for the evening. We played some cribbage which I won and watched some music videos. Fun, Fun.</p>
<p>Monday was a long day schoolwise, I had my silly classes and then a meeting for my syntax seminar.  Oh well needless to say the day ended.  And I actually read history and i don't even have a test/essay in that class until like the 20th. I know you are all impressed with my apparent work ethic.</p>
<p>I guess I will wrap this up for now.</p>
