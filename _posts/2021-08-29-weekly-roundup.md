Last weekend, we took a long weekend in Toronto so that the baby could meet her great grandmother, to see some friends and get some different air. It was a success on all fronts but we did need to get rapid tests to visit my grandmother since we had been out of the province. I accept the need for testing but it is a bit strange that you can drive 5 hours from another province and need to be tested but from 5 hours away in the same province you don't.
