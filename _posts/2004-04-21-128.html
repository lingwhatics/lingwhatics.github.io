<p>One left... And I am ready. I want it to be over though because I am tired of this exams going on for more than two weeks after classes ended... This has never happened to me before.</p>
<p>I got me some marks back and I did pretty good. I got me an A- in Spanish woo... And I got a B+ in Morphology, which was about right for the amount of effort I actually put into that class... Hey I think I went to about 2/3 of the classes, and only 1/4 before the midterm. No, I did not do badly on the midterm and start going to class. I just got tired of sleeping in and having to sit around in the mornings with nothing to do. (I know this sounds crazy to some of you but that's fine I don't care.)</p>
<p>Umm... Yea I got nothing more really. I might just say again that I am done my exams tomorrow morning. And that's a good thing.</p>
