<p>Another day done, another paper returned.  Aâ€“ of course my success makes other people unpleasant but oh well. It isn't my problem what they think about me.  </p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice if one could actually think that. Of course what they think will bother me. Because we live in a society where what others think is often more important that what we think. Anyway...</p>
<p>I should write that history paper tomorrow. Since it is due on wednesday.  I want my printer which would save me 44 cents printing off my history paper in the library, oh well. As long as I get it intime to print off my Swahili paper I will be happy.</p>
<p>Wow! Short disconnected paragraphs.</p>
<p>So, I have been reading Potter #5 and I am enjoying it.  It is quite good.  Anyway, that's enough for right now. </p>
