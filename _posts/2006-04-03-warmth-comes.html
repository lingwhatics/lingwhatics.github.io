<p>Another week closer to the end of the semester and it really seems like time is flying by. I have a handful of things that are due in the next two weeks and many of them are fun. I get to do a 2D drawing of a building, which could be cut out and folded/glued into a 3D model. It should be fun to do.</p>
<p>Today, Heather and I went for a walk downtown because it was so nice out. We ended up at Devonian Gardens and I took some picture there and along the way. It was so nice out in the sun. The pathways were covered with people. It was kind of enjoyable that there weren't too many bikes trying to run you over though. You can check out my pictures <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dalmond/">here</a>.</p>
