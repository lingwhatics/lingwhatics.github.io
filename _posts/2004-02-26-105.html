<p>You know what is funny? I'll tell you. The Blogger spell check doesn't include the word 'blog.'  It didn't make sense to me. Sure it isn't a "real" word but isn't it likely to be used at some point in a blog. </p>
<p>Today was pretty good because I finished my morphology midterm in good time and knew how to do all of it.</p>
<p>I should really do my English homework... I guess I will get to it now.</p>
<p>Song: Einstein on the Beach - Counting Crows<br />
<br />State: So-so... I'm tired but should finish my work before going to bed.</p>
