What am I up to these days? (2020-01-18)

Where: Montreal

What and Why: 

- I am now a member of the OIQ as a professional engineer in Quebec after completing all the requirements (ethics/law exam and French proficiency test)
- I didn't ever get back on track for my goal of reading 30 books last year, but this is a new year and I can try again
- I am working on learning python because it is the language of choice in the office, which is annoying since I didn't learn it before now.
- Enjoying winter in Montreal with the snow, the rain, the cold, the not so cold and wearing plenty of layers.

What's Next:

- Learning to paint (I received watercolours and a large how to paint book for Christmas)
- Planning trips for the next year or so (Confirmed: Halifax [May], Cape Breton [June]; Possible: LA, Paris)
- Practicing my French and taking a French course with my office

Idea for this came from [Peter](https://ruk.ca/content/what-am-i-doing-now "What am I doing /now").
