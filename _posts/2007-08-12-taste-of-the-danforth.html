<p>Friday evening, we went to the Taste of the Danforth. It is really another street festival where people serve you food and you move through crowds. The food was really good. Gyros, spinach pie, churros and samosas. Also, the clouds were really neat this weekend. I have some more from Saturday evening posted on flickr.</p>
