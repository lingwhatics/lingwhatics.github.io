The goal of today's ride was to eat [Adamson Barbecue](https://adamsonbarbecue.com "Adamson Barbecue") and it was a success. The brisket and turkey were delicious and so were the sides of corn bread and coleslaw. 

After the meal, I continued east and went down Don Mills to the valley where I tried a couple trails before going up Rosedale Valley road back home.
 
Total trip distance: 23 km
