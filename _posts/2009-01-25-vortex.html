<p class="flickr-yourcomment">This past week just disappeared. Much like this photo it was some sort of vortex taking time away... well I think the photo vortex is a snow one. But time passing quickly is fine by me. 15.6% of the semester has already passed, which seems like a lot.</p>
<p>After the second week, my courses seem much more interesting and like they will be enjoyable.</p>
