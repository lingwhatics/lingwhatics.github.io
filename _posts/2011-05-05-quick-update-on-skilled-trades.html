<p>Just a quick note about my <a title="Skilled Trades Needed" href="http://lingwhatics.ca/2011/04/09/skilled-trades-needed/" target="_blank">Skilled Trades</a> post.</p>
<p>On my flight from Halifax on Sunday night, I got to talking to my seat neighbour and she is a gold/silversmith. She was saying how terrible it is with the price of silver and gold so high that people are selling and melting down their antique silverware.</p>
<p>She mentioned that there would be hardly anybody out there that had the skills to remake the ornate teas sets and other items that she sees get melted down all the time. So it is not just the building industry that needs a boost for its support for skilled trades. A machine might be able to stamp out many identical sets, but similarity rarely makes ornate items valuable.</p>
<p>Thought I would add this as further evidence of our collective losses.</p>
