<p class="flickr-yourcomment">It wasn't too cold out last weekend. We went for a trip to T &amp; T, which hasn't yet been ruined by Loblaws ownership. I need to find a bit of flowing water for a course assignment. This one is both too large and frozen.</p>
<p>I will likely go into a ravine to find an open stream. It is snowing/raining quite hard today so I might not do that today, but should really get that done sooner rather than later.</p>
