<p>Heather and I are off to Edmontown for the weekend. We are going to attend the Edmonton Rush v. Calgary Roughnecks game. It should be fun. We have managed to get Lisa to join us. I'm sure she will love it and need to take all her friends afterwards.</p>
<p>I started my Theory of Structures class today. The books $350. I'm just so not excited. It was also a really boring first class. Oh well, I will survive.</p>
<p>Book: <span style="font-style:italic;">The Upside of Down</span> by Thomas Homer-Dixon</p>
