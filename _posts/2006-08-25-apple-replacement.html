<p>It seems that everybody I know with an Apple laptop gets a new battery in this recent recall. (<a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2006/08/24/breaking-news-apple-recalls-1-1-million-batteries/">read on TUAW</a>) Even I get a new one. Many of them have really low cycles relatively speaking. Oh well... free battery replacement. I'm sure many people are happy about getting a new one free. Unfortunately, Heather didn't get a new one with the Dell recall, on either of her batteries, which both have 1.5 hour lives about. Too bad.</p>
