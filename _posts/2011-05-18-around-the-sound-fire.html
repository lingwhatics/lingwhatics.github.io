<p>Early this morning, a fire struck the building that houses <a title="Around the Sound" href="http://www.aroundthesoundfood.com/" target="_blank">Around the Sound</a> market where my sister, Kelda, works and recently opened her community kitchen in Owen Sound. From the reports it seems that the fire was mainly in the upper floors of the building, but there is water and smoke damage in the lower floors.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for plans to rebuild the kitchen once more is known about the state of the building. I hope that Anne and Kelda only need to repair the store rather than move again.</p>

<h1 class="3D&quot;h1&quot;">Fire at Around the Sound</h1>
<p>We are so very sad to report that there was a devastating fire early yesterday morning in the building that houses Around the Sound Local Food Market.  The fire<br />
department says it was caused by careless smoking in an apartment above the store.  We are thankful that noone was seriously injured, but four families lost their homes and posessions as the apartments were gutted and the roof destroyed.</p>
<p>The inventory of the store and much of the equipment was ruined by smoke and water, and of course our beautiful new kitchen is no more. The building is uninhabitable.</p>
<p>Thank you to our suppliers, customers and supporters for all your kind words and offers of support.  We will retrieve what we can over the next few days, and then it will be time to talk about next steps.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the 130-plus local farmers, bakers, cooks, gardeners, processors and craftspeople who made Around the Sound what it is will still need your support.  Look for their products and please continue to buy local.</p>
<p>Now is the time for us to consider a collaborative community effort for any future iteration of a local food market.  In my vision, it could find a wonderful home at the heritage CPR rail station on the east harbour.  The city owns the building and recently received a grant for its restoration.  What if we all worked on it together to create a really unique gem on our waterfront, highlighting local food, urban agriculture, and sustainability?  Solar hot water heating, a community kitchen, a seasonal garden and outdoor cafe?  Connecting our heritage with our future - a place of hope, community and innovation as a model of the possibilities.  Well a girl can dream can't she?</p>
<p>Again, thank you for your interest in Around the Sound.  The last two and a half years have been a real adventure and the best part by far was getting to know all of you.</p>
<p>See you soon.<br />
Anne</p>
