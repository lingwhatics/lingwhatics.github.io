<p>Friday, we headed up to our MP's Canada Day party and left shortly after it began out of partial embarrassment and because sitting in a park listening to cover songs didn't seem like a good use of our time.</p>
<p>Instead, we took a walk up Bathurst to explore the western edge of Forest Hill. (Unless that area has another name, maybe a bit of Cedarvale.) The houses were less "updated" on the outside than in the fancier bits of Forest Hill. There were still many trees to provide ample shade on the hot sunny afternoon.</p>
