<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	After a long evening drive around the area and over a strangely high bridge, we stopped so that I could take some star photos.</p>
<p>This is one of many that I got. Stars are quite a finicky subject. Thankfully I had my GorillaPod SLR and stood it on the top of the car.</p>
