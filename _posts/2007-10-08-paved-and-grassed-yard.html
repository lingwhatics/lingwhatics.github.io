<p>If you have to pave your yard then please do this. The paving stones will make it even and the grass or plants can grow up between them.</p>
<p>When it rains the water will be able to infiltrate into the ground and prevent large amounts of rain water from going into the sewers. Contrary to popular belief rain should not all go into the sewer because often the drains are filled with oil, garbage and other things that should not get washed into our water. By infiltrating the water gets back into the proper water cycle.</p>
