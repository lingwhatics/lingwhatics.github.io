I took the day off for a break and to enjoy the nice weather outside (though really I was supposed to be flying to Halifax for my sister's wedding, since postponed). My bike ride took me up to March√© Jean-Talon to get some provisions. It was my first time up there since the end of January and thankfully my regular vendors were all still there.

The ride was good and even the uphills weren't too bad on my legs. I covered some more roads to fill in my map of Montreal, which one day I hope to be a large proportion of my regular neighbourhoods.

Total trip distance: 20.73 km

Moving time: 1h 21m
