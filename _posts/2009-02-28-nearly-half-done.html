<p>I'm nearly half done this semester and finally we are making obvious progress on our design project. In fact, I'm working on it right now; well right now is a break but you get the idea.</p>
<p>Also, at this point, I have interest from two graduate programs. So in the next few weeks, I'm hoping that I will know what I'm going to be doing next year.</p>
<p>Just got back from a walk in Confederation Park with my mum. It was still chilly outside and I wish I had taken my neck tube but that's ok it was sunny. Back to work now.</p>
