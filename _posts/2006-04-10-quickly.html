<p>Yesterday, my camera got a new <a href="https://www.crumpler.ca/cartIndex.php?prodId=199&amp;prodType=Bag&amp;catId=22#">5 million dollar home</a>, it didn't actually cost that much. It is a nice dark bag that doesn't look much like a camera bag. Also, Heather and I had some adventures over the course of the weekend but I should really get to bed soon so I will have to talk about them later.</p>
<p>In other news, I'm drawing a cool 2D cut-out-able model of the Toronto City Hall for my final design drawing it should be awesome. I will take a picture and put it up when it is finished.</p>
