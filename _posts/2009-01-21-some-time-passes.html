<p>I probably shouldn't already be counting down to the end of the semester but the first day seemed like a good time to start and here I am at the end of the 8th of 64 class days and then 3 exams. Last week, I wasn't really sure as to what my classes would be like and they all seemed a bit boring. However, 3/4 have picked up this week and show some promise and the 4th prof will return next week from the middle of nowhere, so maybe that one will be good too.</p>
<p>This semester, I'm working Monday to Friday and it seems like a good plan. I get lots of hours done earlier in the days and so am free to do work and such in the late afternoon/evening. I also end up with weekends free.</p>
<p>Soon I need to get out and take photos. I haven't taken that many since I've been in Calgary.</p>
