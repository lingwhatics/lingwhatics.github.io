What am I up to these days? (2020-07-31)

Where: Montreal

What and Why: 

- I still have not gotten to go to the office for work and it won't happen until September at the earliest.
- I have been working too much to get projects done before the end of July. I expect August will be a bit less hectic. I've just come through a large round of layoffs at work so I am sure I will be busy but less worried about the "what if they let me go" question.
- Took a vacation week and went to Quebec City as part of it. This was a nice change from looking at the same condo and walking in the same places.
- Late July brought getting married in a park with only a notary and the witnesses. There were confused day camp children sitting at picnic tables nearby.

What's Next:

- Learning to paint (I received watercolours and a large how to paint book for Christmas).
- Getting back to practicing my French and taking a French course with my office. I have not spent as much time speaking French while working from home. The amount I listen to has not really changed thought (podcasts and random TV).
- Getting ready for the new arrival in October...

Idea for this came from [Peter](https://ruk.ca/content/what-am-i-doing-now "What am I doing /now").
