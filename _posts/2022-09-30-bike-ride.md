I had to take the day off because the baby couldn't go to daycare so we made the most of the morning by going for a bike ride. We stopped at a playground, went to a couple hardware stores and got some bagels. Almost glove weather at the start of the ride.

Total trip distance: 8.24 km

Moving time: 0h 37m
