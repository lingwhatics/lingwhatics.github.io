<p>I guess I will post something.  Yesterday I went to my aunt's and Uncle's house for Christmas and it was quite enjoyable. Then in the evening I hung out with Lisa.  We watched the Wedding Singer.  what a great movie. though i still don't care much for they hairdos.</p>
<p>I don't think I slept much last night. I was laying in bed feeling quite unwell.  Anyhow I think that is all I will write for today. I might go see Lost In Translation again because it was quite a good movie.</p>
<p>Song: None (but if there were one it would be Somewhere I Belong by Linkin Park)<br />
<br />State: sort of hungry but not feeling very good and nobody is emailing me back (by nobody i have someone in particular in mind)</p>
