Headed out east to see the paths around the Olympic park and then back through the Plateau to get croissants at my favourite place (Au Kouing-Amann), but they are on vacation for another couple weeks. Today's ride took me through a bunch of areas that I have not even walked yet, but I will definitely get back over there to explore.

Total trip distance: 29.33 km
