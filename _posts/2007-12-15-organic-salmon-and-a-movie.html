<p>This was my dinner from my work party.</p>
<p>Today, Heather and I went to see <span style="font-style:italic;">Juno</span>. It was a really good movie and when it opens in your town you should see it too.</p>
<p>Then we went on a long subway trip to the west and and then a bus ride south to the Sherway Gardens area so I could get a new external hard drive and antenna. I have to reposition the antenna. The tuner almost picks up NBC, CBS and ABC, which was the goal of the exercise. A nice 500GB hard drive, but I wish it had FireWire since it is faster than USB most of the time.</p>
<p>So far it was a good weekend and there is still another day.</p>
