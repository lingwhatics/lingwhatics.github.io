A longer ride on my new tires. Smooth ride around a loop with road, bike path and a couple bridges. Very nice day for a ride and not too busy on the paths. There were some police on the ice control bridge treating a rider who appeared to have crashed and had a pretty large road rash on one leg. Thankfully it did not look broken, they mostly needed the leg to be cleaned up and some time to recover from the fall.

Total trip distance: 18.49 km

Moving time: 0h 54m
