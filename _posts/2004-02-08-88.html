<p>Look an update... Umm... I don't really know what I want to write today. I am kind of tired. I don't think I studied as much as I had planned to this weekend but I did clean my desk. If you saw it you wouldn't believe me but I washed all the dust off it, even from under my computer. </p>
<p>I watched much too much basketball yesterday. I watched 2 full games and part of another. It was kind of a waste of time but the 2nd game turned out to be a good one and Stanford won in the last second, to keep their undefeated streak alive.</p>
<p>I had a really good night last night. Watched <em>My Cousin Vinny</em> and played some <em>Scattergories</em>. Oh and watched some of <em>SNL</em>, despite having Megan Mullaly on, it wasn't really that funny. At least not most of the sketches.</p>
