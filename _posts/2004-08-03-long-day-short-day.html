<p>I haven't written for a whole day... I actually thought it was longer ago than that. Oh well, Monday seemed like a really long day at work, it was quite dead until late in the afternoon, then it picked up like crazy. And I got off a bit later than I had expected because things take time to cook.</p>
<p>But as I was walking home last night Jamie caught up to me and then we came here and Meghan and Tyson came over to watch a movie. The movie was interesting, but very odd. It was called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0282698/"><span style="font-style:italic;">Love Liza</span></a> and that's about all I can say about it. It wasn't my favorite, but it was not my least favorite either.</p>
<p>Today, I got called early to go to work, which worked out fine for me because I wanted to go to the library after work and to the bank and the library would have been closed had I worked my normal shift. Only two more days in my 9 days of work, and 17 days of work this summer. I imagine I will get a job when I go back to Edmonton but who knows where... maybe Julio's.</p>
