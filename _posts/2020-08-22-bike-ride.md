Saturday morning ride on the paths of Parc Jean-Drapeau. Most of these paths have been inside the fence of whatever event was happening at the time of my previous rides. It was nice to be able to see more of the island.

Total trip distance: 15.27 km

Moving time: 0h 53m

Zoomed in image. I even went to the southern tip of the island where there is a compass rose and some benches.
