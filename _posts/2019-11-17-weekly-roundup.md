Vacation time has ended. Even though I was gone for 10 days, it seemed like it was a quick trip because of all the driving. Florida is a lot of driving and every things is 30 minutes away from where you are except Miami which is 2 hours away even if you're in Miami. Peruvian food was the order of the day in Florida as I went to a ceviche restaurant that was delicious and a Peruvian sandwich shop (also delicious). Wynwood walls is a cool attraction and there are several breweries in the neighourhood that warrant another visit when I have more time to explore. Also on the agenda was attending a wedding that had a great doughnut spread along with a cheese wheel cake.

Next up was five days in El Salvador, which I'll write more about later.
