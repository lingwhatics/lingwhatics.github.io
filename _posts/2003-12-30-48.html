<p>I don't know what I want to write but I think I want to write something. </p>
<p>Alright so here I go.  I watched the Matrix : Revolutions last night and I didn't think it was possible to make a worse movie than the second one but they succeeded.  So it was bad. oh well i didn't pay anything to see it. except with my time.</p>
<p>Umm... yea i don't know what to write now because well there isn't anything to write I guess. Except that I don't want to take the bus up to Edmonton because then i have to get back to my house from the bus station. anyway whatever. clearly it isn't important. neither is what i am thinking so i won't write it to save myself trouble later.</p>

<br />State: Nobody would figure out even if i could do stuff with them</p>
