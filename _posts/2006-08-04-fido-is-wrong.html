<p>I really hope this doesn't become my new monthly post. My <a href="http://www.fido.ca" rel="tag">FIDO</a> bill was wrong again this month. They charged me for my text messages that are included in my package. It is annoying to have to call them to get it fixed. The rep I got today said there were lots of calls about this subject and that they were trying to fix it. Of course, that doesn't really help me unless they actually fix it not try to.</p>
<p>It worked fine until 3 months ago so why can't they just go back and see what they changed in the billing system then and undo that in some way. I know it might not be that simple but unless ROGERS is trying to get everybody to leave FIDO by making the service shitty then it doesn't make much sense.</p>
<p>Anyway, hopefully I won't have to post on this topic again.</p>
