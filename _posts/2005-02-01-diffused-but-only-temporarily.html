<p>Today was my last day of not working, hopefully for a long while (not including weekends). I start at Access tomorrow and that should be fun. I also have to get to class after I finish work so I really hope that works out nicely. Tonight, I went to see <span style="font-style:italic;">Shark Tale</span> with Jamie. It was funny, but it had way too much product placement, especially as a movie for kids. (That's what comes from marketing: all things evil thrust from the corporation.)</p>
<p>I have a rant about universities coming but I don't have enough time tonight to put it down on here, so that will be for another day. Maybe I will write something about it while I'm on the bus tomorrow.</p>
