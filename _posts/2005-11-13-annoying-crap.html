<p>I'm so fucking tired of Christmas, every store has ads saying get your great xmas deals. It isn't even a month before yet and the mall is packed with people spending more money than they have brains on things that they don't need. The whole stupid deal is a waste of time.</p>
<p>I also don't like at work when they don't leave me a memo and then I have to stop doing something because they got a complaint about what I was doing because I wasn't told to not do whatever it was in the first place.</p>
<p>That's all for now, I have to do some more stats questions.</p>
<p>Sound: Flames winning hockey game. (First 6 game streak since 1994)</p>
