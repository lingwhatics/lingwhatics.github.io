<p>I know it has been a while since the last post. I have been busy and all the times I wanted to post something else ended up happening. Last night, I was all ready to post something when my lab was finished except that I didn't ever finish my lab last night. At 1.30 a.m. I decided to go to bed and figure it out today. However, as of this point I don't have any large labs to complete for a few weeks and I only have a few quizzes and assignments left. One midterm but that isn't until the 30th and that class is straight forward.<br /><span class="down" style="display:block;" id="formatbar_CreateLink" title="Link"></span><br />Other than that not much has been happening. The madness began today and Gonzaga didn't lose. The guys in my design lab were hoping that they would because they all wanted Xavier to go far for some reason. Oh well. I will be planting myself in front of my TV tomorrow afternoon and watching the exciting action.</p>
<p>I filed my taxes online last week and today I had my refund deposited in my bank account. I was amazed with the speed, but I guess there aren't that many people who have actually filed their taxes already.</p>
<p>Tomorrow night, Heather and I are going to see <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/go/">Go!</a> at the EPCOR centre. I hope that it is as good as it usually is when I listen to it on Saturday morning in bed.</p>
<p>Song: Trouble Sleeping - The Perishers<br />Book: <span style="font-style:italic;">Neither Here Nor There</span> - Bill Bryson (I have had this one on the go for quite a while, but I only have about 30 pages left now so I will finish it soon)</p>
