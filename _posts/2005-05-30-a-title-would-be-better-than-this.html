<p>Yesterday, I went to the Lilac festival with Heather, Jamie and my sisters. It was fun, but I burnt the top of my feet.</p>
<p>Today, work was ok. There wasn't much to do today. The cooks cleaned the cooking areas quite thoroughly, and I was done about 45 minutes before I usually am.</p>
<p>I am hoping that the engineering dept. gets it's entrance grades ready soon because I want to know about my school stuff. I found out about my admission for the UofA like the 2nd week of June before I started going there, so I think the UofC gets about another week.</p>
<p>Song: Brian Wilson - Barenaked Ladies<br />Book: Same as below and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Economist</span>, since I get it every week in the mail now.</p>
