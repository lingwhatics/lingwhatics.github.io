<p>So I finally can wash my clothes.  Our washing machine has been acting up for a couple weeks and now it is all happy and working.  But of course I went and cleaned my clothes elsewhere today just before it was fixed. oh well they are clean just the same.</p>
<p>I have a midterm tomorrow and I am pretty sure that I am ready for it.  Though there is that huge map of language families to know. I will remember.</p>
<p>Anyway, a few people need Birthday wishes.  CB, Roo and Sophie.  Happy Birthday.</p>
