<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/"><span style="font-style:italic;">Shaun of the Dead</span></a> and  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374277/"><span style="font-style:italic;">Touch of Pink</span></a>, those are the movies that were watched tonight, at least at Jamie's. The first being quite funny, and now I understand where the "there's no 'I' in 'team' but there is in 'pie', 'meat pie'" thing came from. The second was kind of painful and so-so, though it did have its moments. Not saying that it is a bad movie but it wasn't my favorite. I liked <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303785/">Bollywood/Hollywood</a> much better and it was supposedly not a good movie, perhaps I forget what it was like and just remember liking it when I didn't, I have done that before.</p>
<p>I found this quite amusing line on <a href="http://scottishthirty.blogspot.com/2004/12/when-he-comes-to-buy-your-soul-sage.html">this blog</a> I was reading today:<br />
<blockquote>michael's [store full of weird blobs of fake wax fruit that more often than not have teeth marks in them from wee children, and other craft supplies]</p></blockquote>
<p>My favorite part is the teeth marks. I don't even remember why I was reading the blog. It probably was something to do with looking at people's blogs who had the same book interests as I do.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is late and I should go to bed. I hope that I get a job in the first few days of the week because it will make me feel much better. I have to remember to look up where my First Aid and CPR course is this weekend. Well I know it is at the university and presumably in Campus Rec, but precisely where I do not know.</p>
