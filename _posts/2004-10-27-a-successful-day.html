<p>Today was quite productive. I managed to condense all my Discourse Analysis notes into seven pages front and back, although it did take quite a while. I didn't think that it would take most of the day, but that doesn't matter because I wasn't doing anything else today that was pressing.</p>
<p>Though, I did apply to U of C Engineering for Fall 2005. I applied to a combined program of Civil Engineering and Linguistics, with Geomatics Engineering as my second choice. My online application says that they already have my transcripts from both high school and U of A, though I still need to send them new ones at the end of this semester.</p>
<p>I guess that's all for today.</p>
