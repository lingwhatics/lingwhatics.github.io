<p>This old house/office on Avenue had its sidewalk completely covered with a thick layer of salt. Presumably they wanted to prevent the upcoming snow storm from sticking, but it seems a bit excessive. It is also really unfriendly to the environment, since most of it will runoff into the sewer and then to the lake.</p>
