<p>Look over there a post... So now I have finished 2 out of my six-million nine-hundred and thirty-seven exams and well I dunno... Multiple choice on language tests is stupid... It becomes just like those high school French finals where "le chien brun" was a)-c) and "le chien noir" was d), when in actuality the dog was red but you had to choose c) or else it was wrong... Oh well. I'm sure it will be fine.</p>
<p>And now I'm bored. I don't feel like studying for morphology because the material isn't exactly engaging, same goes for sociolinguistics, and my other two exams are so far away I don't even see the point in starting.</p>
<p>Song: Some crappy thing the guy on the floor below is playing<br />
<br />State: Goat on fire<br />
<br />Book: In a Sunburned Country - Bill Bryson. I haven't read more than a chapter a day in the last 2 days and didn't read it for like a week before that.</p>
