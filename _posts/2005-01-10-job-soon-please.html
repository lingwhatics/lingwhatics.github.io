<p>It's Sunday night, well only in the sense of the last time I got up it was Sunday, but anyway that isn't important. This weekend, I did my Standard First Aid course. It was actually quite a bit more fun that I had expected that it would be. I was a bit worried before it started that I would have to show things to the instructors with lots of people watching but there were never more than 8 people out of the 19 in the course that were "sitting off". It was good and I only got one wrong on the written test, and don't worry my answer was close to the right one. It was just the next step in the sequence.</p>
<p>Over the past week Jamie and I have been playing <span style="font-style:italic;">Simpsons' Road Rage</span> on PS2 and we are hoping that we can unlock the last 4 cars and see the end movie. I know it seems like a silly thing to spend our nights doing but it beats sitting around watching TV.</p>
<p>I am trying to get a job doing data entry for an oil company because I hear they pay well and that will make my life easier since I will be able to save up all my tuition for the rest of my degree and then I can work a lower paying job if necessary while I am actually going to school. I have been thinking for the last week or so that I wanted to take a course this semester, but the two I would choose from have not had open spaces in them so it is looking less like I will take one. I might take on in the spring or summer term that would be good if I could do that. I am going to try to take the second engineering design class that I need to take in the summer term, if it is offered.</p>
<p>I guess I should go to bed soon since it is quite late.</p>
