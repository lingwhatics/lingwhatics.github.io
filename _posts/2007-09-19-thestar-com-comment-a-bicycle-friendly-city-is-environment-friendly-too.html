<p><a href="https://www.thestar.com/comment/article/257266">TheStar.com | comment | A bicycle-friendly city is environment-friendly, too</a><br />Too bad the city of Toronto doesn't seem to understand this. Bike lanes in "convenient" places for the city are not convenient for users. Why does it seem that where the road gets busy they take away the bike lanes as to not inconvenience the motorists.</p>
