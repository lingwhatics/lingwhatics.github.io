<p>I kept track of all the times I used transit in 2014. This only includes transit on the TTC, which is most of all my transit use. I took 206 rides this year. These are counted in the way the TTC would charge for rides, so when I have a day pass a "ride" is counted whenever I would need to deposit a token or tap my Presto card.</p>
<p>My rides were paid for using: Day Passes (92), Tokens (70), Presto (33), and borrowed passes (11). The Day Pass rides were generally quite cheap because the passes were used on weekends and shared with Heather.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, I used the TTC most on Saturdays when Day Passes can be shared. I walk to/from work every day so only use the TTC when I have to go somewhere outside my acceptable walking distance. I am not sure what acceptable walking distance is as it changes depending on the day/weather/time.</p>

<p>Splitting my day of week walking out for each months is not all that interesting except to note that I only took transit on Saturday in June.</p>

<p>Total rides each month do not tell me much except that I was out a lot in September (a many birthday month), and went to many Christmas parties in November/December.<br />
