Out for a random ride today. I went toward Verdun and then popped over to the Lachine Canal. I tried out a newer path that passes over the 20 along the 138 before turning up a short steep hill on Brock Ave. After this I went over the familiar Maisonneuve cycleway. 

Total trip distance: 19.86 km

Moving time: 0h 59m

Today's ride:
