<p>This week is finally over.  I don't know how this week really went, but that's ok because i'm pretty sure it wasn't bad overall.  Two midterms, and two essays were due but i finished all those and am pretty sure I have made it through.</p>
<p>Why is it that I never seem to get the girl. It's just disappointing.  I wish I would just say what I have decided I should say.  Alas, I do not usually.  I am determined to speak my mind this time. </p>
<p>I saw a good movie tonight, Station Agent.  I enjoyed it and it had some funny parts. I would not recommend it to my friends because they just wouldn't like it or how it turns out, so do not think you should see it because i think it is good.</p>
<p>I'm so tired I think I'm going to get some sleep, maybe I will actually get more than two or three hours of sleep tonight.</p>
<p>State: Disappointed in me.<br />

<p>It will be the day words are spoken and a positive answer is returned.</p>
