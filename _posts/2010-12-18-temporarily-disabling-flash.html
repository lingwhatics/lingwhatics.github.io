<p>Decided I liked browsing without Flash on all the time. I don't mind ads on websites. I just hate when they take over the page and screw with the formatting. So I started disabling Flash in the Firefox plugins, but it was annoying needing to have the plugins window always open. I found an add-on called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1237/">QuickJava</a> works well. It puts buttons in the bottom right of the window so I can easily disable javascript, java, Flash, Silverlight, images and styles. Much nicer than having the window open in the background.</p>
