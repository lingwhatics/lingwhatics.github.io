<p>Today, I saw a great movie. It was really funny. Both the French and the English parts were funny. You should all go see it. I hope you know what it is already... but if you don't it was <span style="font-style:italic;">Bon Cop, Bad Cop</span>. All the reviews says that it was ok but I really think it is one of the better films I have seen in a long time.<br />Go see it... Allez...</p>
