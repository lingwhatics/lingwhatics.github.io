I was meant to have a day off with my sister, but the airline decided to reroute her through Toronto instead. So I went for a long bike ride up St-Denis REV, crossed to Laval, rode along rivi√®re des Prairies before coming back across the train bridge path. As you can see on the map, I opened up a whole part of the city that I haven't ridden through before.

Total trip distance: 40.04 km

Moving time: 2h 27m
