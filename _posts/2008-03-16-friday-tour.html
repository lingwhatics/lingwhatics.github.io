<p class="flickr-yourcomment"> On Friday, about half my office went to Pearson for a tour of the various airport facilities. Our tour started with the South fire station, which is neat. The trucks are huge and can be loaded with such a large amount of water. The photo is one of the newest trucks.</p>
<p>We walked along the gates in terminal 1 and the domestic baggage make-up area. We went up one of the towers where I got a nice panorama. In the afternoon we went to the Air Canada operations room. It is full of workers with 4 or 6 computer monitors; all taking care of various airplane operations on the gates and making sure all things are working.</p>
<p>It was interesting to see many of the things that I am simulating at work from day to day.</p>
