<p class="flickr-yourcomment">There were many streetcars and buses at various stages of being rebuilt. The TTC was very nice this year and let us "take as many pictures as" we wanted to this year. Last year for Doors Open, we could not take any photos and it sort of made me unhappy.</p>
<p>I didn't take that many photos in there but I got quite a few that I like.</p>
