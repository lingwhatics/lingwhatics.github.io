<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	Saturday, I went on my own to map more of the streets above Lawrence between Yonge and Bayview. Heather was off with her friend. I met up with them later in the afternoon to see a Fringe Festival show called Opera on the Rock. It was shown in a pub and the performers were at the bar and walking around the room. It was funny and they sang almost all of the show. </p>
<p>The evening was spent sitting in the apartment just hanging out. Today, we went down to the Harbourfront Centre to see what was on but having arrived too late/early we left and took a walk up Bathurst. Ending our trek at the subway and getting some groceries. It was a nice weekend, though some rain would be welcome.</p>
